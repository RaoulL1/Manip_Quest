	abstract = {Résumé L’entretien motivationnel est une technique psychothérapeutique qui a pour but d’amener un patient à résoudre son ambivalence face à un comportement problématique pour l’amener au changement. But de l’article : proposer une synthèse des concepts de l’entretien motivationnel dans la pratique quotidienne de l’entretien psychiatrique ainsi qu’un bref rappel des domaines où cette technique a démontré son efficacité. Méthode : les concepts présentés font référence au livre de Miller et Rollnick (2002). Nous avons réalisé une revue systématique de la littérature selon les critères PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis ) pour présenter un inventaire exhaustif des domaines où l’efficacité de l’entretien motivationnel a été démontrée. Le paradigme de recherche était : «  motivational AND (interviewing OR enhancement)  ». Résultats : cent vingt-neuf articles ont été inclus dans l’étude qualitative. L’entretien motivationnel se distingue des autres approches thérapeutiques essentiellement par l’attitude du thérapeute, qui va défendre le statu quo , face au patient qui défendra le changement et découvrira ainsi sa motivation par inférence. Les résistances ne seront pas interprétées comme attribuables au seul patient mais le signe d’une dissonance entre patient et thérapeute qui amènera le thérapeute à en explorer les causes pour éclairer et résoudre l’ambivalence du patient. La notion « d’essai » est fondamentale, pour ne pas attribuer l’échec à des facteurs internes stables du patient mais à des circonstances. La rechute est davantage la règle que l’exception, et chaque rechute rapproche le thérapeute et le patient du succès consolidé. L’entretien motivationnel a été développé initialement dans l’addiction à l’alcool, et a également solidement confirmé son efficacité dans plusieurs domaines : l’utilisation du préservatif et l’observance médicamenteuse chez les patients atteints du VIH, le tabagisme, l’abus de substance, les règles hygiéno-diététiques dans la 052 prévention des maladies cardio-vasculaires. Comparativement, peu d’études ont été faites dans les maladies psychiatriques : quelques études ont porté (par ordre décroissant de nombre de publications) sur la schizophrénie, le trouble obsessionnel compulsif, l’anorexie mentale, et le trouble anxieux généralisé. À notre connaissance, aucune étude ne porte sur l’entretien motivationnel dans les troubles de l’humeur, la boulimie, les troubles de personnalité et le risque suicidaire. Les techniques de l’entretien motivationnel semblent aspécifiques et pourraient être potentiellement efficaces dans ces domaines, ainsi que dans d’autres spécialités médicales que la psychiatrie.},

	abstract = {Background: ‘Self-objectification’ is the tendency to experience one’s body principally as an object, to be evaluated for its appearance rather than for its effectiveness. Within objectification theory, it has been proposed that self-objectification accounts for the poorer interoceptive awareness observed in women, as measured by heartbeat perception. Our study is, we believe, the first specifically to test this relationship.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a well-validated and reliable heartbeat perception task, we measured interoceptive awareness in women and compared this with their scores on the Self-Objectification Questionnaire, the Self-Consciousness Scale and the Body Consciousness Questionnaire. Interoceptive awareness was negatively correlated with selfobjectification. Interoceptive awareness, public body consciousness and private body consciousness together explained 31\% of the variance in self-objectification. However, private body consciousness was not significantly correlated with interoceptive awareness, which may explain the many nonsignificant results in self-objectification studies that have used private body consciousness as a measure of body awareness.
Conclusions/Significance: We propose interoceptive awareness, assessed by heartbeat perception, as a measure of body awareness in self-objectification studies. Our findings have implications for those clinical conditions, in women, which are characterised by self-objectification and low interoceptive awareness, such as eating disorders.},

This study aimed to identify prospective predictors of each construct and to determine their relative importance in predicting dietary restraint and binge eating. Eight- to 13-year-old boys and girls (N = 259) were assessed at baseline and one-year follow-up, using a range of measures that included the Child Eating Disorder Examination. Psychosocial variables predicted overconcern with weight and shape whilst objective weight predicted body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction and weight and shape concern predicted restraint, and weight and shape concern and restraint predicted binge eating. Findings provide support for the theoretical differences between body dissatisfaction and overconcern with weight and shape, and highlight the importance of focusing on speciﬁc body image variables.},

	abstract = {Body image concern has long been linked with unhealthy restrained eating patterns among women, yet scant research has examined factors to disrupt this process. At the same time, feminine stereotypes prescribe that women should be small, restrict their movements, speak softly, and limit their food intake (e.g., through dieting). Here, we examined whether women’s postural constriction or expansion moderated the relation between body shape concern and restrained eating, predicting that expansive postures would interrupt this robust relation. As a secondary aim, we investigated whether women spontaneously adopted constrictive postures and to what extent postures contributed to restrained eating under baseline conditions. Specifically, women’s postural position (constricted, expanded, or baseline posture) was manipulated and restrained eating was measured. Results showed that at high levels of body shape concern, women sitting in expansive postures restrained their eating less compared to women in constrictive postures. Further, spontaneously expansive (vs. spontaneously constrictive) postures were associated with less restrained eating among women. Thus, postural expansion attenuated the link between body shape concern and restrained eating whereas postural constriction exacerbated the link. Implications for gender performativity and possible interventions for restrained eating are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective: Numerous reports advocate that training of the proprioceptive sense is a viable behavioral therapy for improving impaired motor function. However, there is little agreement of what constitutes proprioceptive training and how effective it is. We therefore conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the available literature in order to provide clarity to the notion of training the proprioceptive system.
Methods: Four major scientiﬁc databases were searched. The following criteria were subsequently applied: (1) A quantiﬁed pre- and post-treatment measure of proprioceptive function. (2) An intervention or training program believed to inﬂuence or enhance proprioceptive function. (3) Contained at least one form of treatment or outcome measure that is indicative of somatosensory function. From a total of 1284 articles, 51 studies fulﬁlled all criteria and were selected for further review.
Results: Overall, proprioceptive training resulted in an average improvement of 52\% across all outcome measures. Applying muscle vibration above 30 Hz for longer durations (i.e., min vs. s) induced outcome improvements of up to 60\%. Joint position and target reaching training consistently enhanced joint position sense (up to 109\%) showing an average improvement of 48\%. Cortical stroke was the most studied disease entity but no clear evidence indicated that proprioceptive training is differentially beneﬁcial across the reported diseases.
Conclusions: There is converging evidence that proprioceptive training can yield meaningful improvements in somatosensory and sensorimotor function. However, there is a clear need for further work. Those forms of training utilizing both passive and active movements with and without visual feedback tended to be most beneﬁcial. There is also initial evidence suggesting that proprioceptive training induces cortical reorganization, reinforcing the notion that proprioceptive training is a viable method for improving sensorimotor function.},

Little is known about the neural systems underlying these sex-linked differences in risk and resiliency. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a task involving the visual perception of pointlight displays of coherent and scrambled biological motion, we discovered sex differences in the development of neural systems for basic social perception. In adults, we identiﬁed enhanced activity during coherent biological motion perception in females relative to males in a network of brain regions previously implicated in social perception including amygdala, medial temporal gyrus, and temporal pole. These sex differences were less pronounced in our sample of school-age youth. We hypothesize that the robust neural circuitry supporting social perception in females, which diverges from males beginning in childhood, may underlie sex differences in disorders related to social processing.},

Internal representations including body schema and representations of the outside world develop with learning and actions throughout ontogenesis and are constantly updated based on different sensory inputs. The aim of this review is to present some concepts and experimental data about body schema, internal representations and updating process during childhood and adolescence, as obtained using a neurosensory approach. From our developmental studies, it was possible to explore the slow maturation of the sensorimotor representations by examining the anticipatory control. By manipulating proprioceptive and visual information, which are at the heart of the construction of body schema, we wished to highlight notable differences between adolescents and young adults on both a postural and perceptual level, which conﬁrms the late maturation of multisensory integration for central motor control.},

Consequently, the way we represent our body has profound implications in the way we process and locate sensations and in turn perform appropriate actions. The body can be the subject, but also the object of our experience, providing information from sensations on the body surface and viscera, but also knowledge of the body as a physical object. However, the extent to which different senses contribute to constructing the rich and uniﬁed body representations we all experience remains unclear. In this review, we aim to bring together recent research showing important roles for several different sensory modalities in constructing body representations. At the same time, we hope to generate new ideas of how and at which level the senses contribute to generate the different levels of body representations and how they interact. We will present an overview of some of the most recent neuropsychological evidence about multisensory control of pain, and the way that visual, auditory, vestibular and tactile systems contribute to the creation of coherent representations of the body. We will focus particularly on some of the topics discussed in the symposium on Multimodal Contributions to Body Representation held on the 15th International Multisensory Research Forum (2015, Pisa, Italy).},

	abstract = {Interoception, the sense of the physiological condition of the body originating from within its internal organs, and body image, namely the perception, feelings and attitudes one has about one’s body, are two fundamental components of our sense of personal identity and overall well-being. However, the relation between interoception and body image remains poorly understood. We here review recent behavioural and neuroimaging evidence from non-clinical and clinical populations (e.g. eating disorders) to propose that basic interoceptive processes and interoceptive awareness may crucially contribute to the complex formation of body image, as well as to its disturbances. In particular, lower interoceptive accuracy and awareness are associated with body-image concerns. We provide a potential mechanistic explanation of the link between interoception and body image, which aims to integrate interoceptive and exteroceptive representations of the body. The suggested link between interoception and body image can inform new empirically testable hypotheses on the underlying neurocognitive processes that are central to body image concerns and disturbances, and motivate relevant clinical implications.},

Changes in regional cerebral blood (rCBF) of nine patients with anorexia nervosa restrictive type (AN), 13 patients with bulimia nervosa purging type (BN) and 12 controls following three experiments with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were compared: at rest, following a landscape video presentation (neutral stimulus), and after their filmed body image (positive stimulus) exposure. Body distortion was measured with the Silhouette test and body dissatisfaction with the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Patients with AN showed a hyperactivation of the left parietal and right superior frontal from neutral to positive stimulus. Patients with BN showed a hyperactivation of the right temporal and right occipital areas. Changes in BSQ responses were associated with changes in the right inferior frontal and right temporal rCBF, whereas changes in body distortion were related to the left parietal. The activation of the right temporal after the own body image exposure might be in accordance with the aversive events' response. Functional abnormalities in AN might be related to the storage of a distorted prototypical image of the body in the left parietal lobe.},

	abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN), a severe mental disorder with an onset during adolescence, has been found to be difficult to treat. Identifying variables that predict long-term outcome may help to develop better treatment strategies. Since body image distortion and weight gain are central elements of diagnosis and treatment of AN, the current study investigated perceptual body image distortion, defined as the accuracy of evaluating one’s own perceived body size in relation to the actual body size, as well as total and early weight gain during inpatient treatment as predictors for long-term outcome in a sample of 76 female adolescent AN patients. Long-term outcome was defined by physical, psychological and psychosocial adjustment using the Morgan–Russell outcome assessment schedule as well as by the mere physical outcome consisting of menses and/or BMI approximately 3 years after treatment. Perceptual body image distortion and early weight gain predicted long-term outcome (explained variance 13.3 \%), but not the physical outcome alone. This study provides first evidence for an association of perceptual body image distortion with long-term outcome of adolescent anorexia nervosa and underlines the importance of sufficient early weight gain.},

Then, participants completed a number of measures and reported their self-evaluations. In line with the self-validation hypothesis, we predicted and found that the effect of the direction of thoughts (positive/negative) on self-related attitudes was signiﬁcantly greater when participants wrote their thoughts in the conﬁdent than in the doubtful posture. These postures did not inﬂuence the number or quality of thoughts listed, but did have an impact on the conﬁdence with which people held their thoughts. Copyright \# 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Body size misperception is common amongst the general public and is a core component of eating disorders and related conditions. While perennial media exposure to the “thin ideal” has been blamed for this misperception, relatively little research has examined visual adaptation as a potential mechanism. We examined the extent to which the bodies of “self” and “other” are processed by common or separate mechanisms in young women. Using a contingent adaptation paradigm, experiment 1 gave participants prolonged exposure to images both of the self and of another female that had been distorted in opposite directions (e.g., expanded other/contracted self), and assessed the aftereffects using test images both of the self and other. The directions of the resulting perceptual biases were contingent on the test stimulus, establishing at least some separation between the mechanisms encoding these body types. Experiment 2 used a cross adaptation paradigm to further investigate the extent to which these mechanisms are independent. Participants were adapted either to expanded or to contracted images of their own body or that of another female. While adaptation effects were largest when adapting and testing with the same body type, conﬁrming the separation of mechanisms reported in experiment 1, substantial misperceptions were also demonstrated for cross adaptation conditions, demonstrating a degree of overlap in the encoding of self and other. In addition, the evidence of misperception of one’s own body following exposure to “thin” and to “fat” others demonstrates the viability of visual adaptation as a model of body image disturbance both for those who underestimate and those who overestimate their own size.},

Adult and adolescent patients (n = 376) completed assessments upon admission to a partial hospital programme. Analyses examined the factor structure of the MAIA, scale means, scale–scale correlations, internal consistency and construct validity. Analyses also examined associations between MAIA subscales and eating disorder symptoms. Results supported the original eight‐factor structure of the MAIA. Internal consistency was acceptable, and the scales converged with associated measures. Importantly, Not Distracting, Self‐regulation, Body Listening and Trusting were most strongly associated with eating disorder symptoms. Results support use of the MAIA among eating disorders and provide further support for the relevance of IA in eating disorders.

	abstract = {Own body perception, and differentiating and comparing one's body to another person's body, are common cognitive functions that have relevance for self-identity and social interactions. In several psychiatric conditions, including anorexia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, gender dysphoria, and autism spectrum disorder, self and own body perception, as well as aspects of social communication are disturbed. Despite most of these conditions having skewed prevalence sex ratios, little is known about whether the neural basis of own body perception differs between the sexes. We addressed this question by investigating brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a Body Perception task in 15 male and 15 female healthy participants. Participants viewed their own body, bodies of same-sex, or opposite-sex other people, and rated the degree that they appeared like themselves. We found that men and women did not differ in the pattern of brain activation during own body perception compared to a scrambled control image. However, when viewing images of other bodies of same-sex or opposite-sex, men showed significantly stronger activations in attention-related and reward-related brain regions, whereas women engaged stronger activations in striatal, medial-prefrontal, and insular cortices, when viewing the own body compared to other images of the opposite sex. It is possible that other body images, particularly of the opposite sex, may be of greater salience for men, whereas images of own bodies may be more salient for women. These observations provide tentative neurobiological correlates to why women may be more vulnerable than men to conditions involving own body perception.},

	abstract = {Social cognition is the collection of cognitive processes required to understand and interact with others. The term ‘social brain’ refers to the network of brain regions that underlies these processes. Recent evidence suggests that a number of social cognitive functions continue to develop during adolescence, resulting in age differences in tasks that assess cognitive domains including face processing, mental state inference and responding to peer inﬂuence and social evaluation. Concurrently, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies show differences between adolescent and adult groups within parts of the social brain. Understanding the relationship between these neural and behavioural observations is a challenge. This review discusses current research ﬁndings on adolescent social cognitive development and its functional MRI correlates, then integrates and interprets these ﬁndings in the context of hypothesised developmental neurocognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The sense of embodiment is vital for self recognition. An examination of anosognosia for hemiplegia—the inability to recognise that one is paralysed down one side of one’s body—suggests the existence of ‘online’ and ‘oﬄine’ representations of the body. Online representations of the body are representations of the body as it is currently, are newly constructed moment by moment and are directly ‘‘plugged into” current perception of the body. In contrast, oﬄine representations of the body are representations of what the body is usually like, are relatively stable and are constructed from online representations. This distinction is supported by an analysis of phantom limb—the feeling that an amputated limb is still present—phenomena. Initially it seems that the sense of embodiment may arise from either of these types of representation; however, an integrated representation of the body seems to be required. It is suggested information from vision and emotions is involved in generating these representations. A lack of access to online representations of the body does not necessarily lead to a loss in the sense of embodiment. An integrated oﬄine representation of the body could account for the sense of embodiment and perform the functions attributed to this sense.},

Participants were 220 college women and 75 college men who completed an online survey containing this new assessment and established measures of body image and psychosocial functioning. Results conﬁrmed that the Body Image Disturbance Questionnaire was internally consistent and free of impression-management response bias. For both sexes, the measure converged appropriately with other body image indices (evaluation, affect, investment, and impact), was positively correlated with depression, social anxiety, and eating disturbance. Scores on this assessment also predicted psychosocial functioning above and beyond body dissatisfaction as a predictor. Greater body image disturbance was observed among women than men, among heavier than lighter women, and among White than African American women. Limitations and future research implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Body image distortion is a core symptom of eating disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on body image processing, described different patterns of neural response, mainly involving the inferior and superior parietal lobules, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with conﬂicting results.
Methods: The neural response to the view of their own body pictures (normal size and distorted) was evaluated in 18 female anorexia nervosa (AN) restricting type patients, and in 19 healthy female subjects (HC) using fMRI. Clinical assessment was performed by means of the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV and self-reported questionnaires.
Results: In response to the body image distortion, patients and controls showed an inverse pattern of activation, with the widest extent of activation in the oversize condition in AN, while in the undersize condition in HC. AN and HC showed a similar pattern of neural response to the view of their own body, with an increased activation in the extrastriate body area, superior and inferior parietal lobule and prefrontal areas, although the extent of activation in HC was more limited as compared with AN patients. Increased activity in AN patients, compared with HC, was observed in the DLPFC in response to the oversized body picture and a signiﬁcant correlation was found in AN patients between DLPFC activation and eating disorder psychopathology.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest the existence of a continuum from normalcy to pathology in neural response to body image, and conﬁrm the clinical relevance of body image distortion in AN, reinforcing the key role of attentive, executive and self-evaluation networks in AN visual processing of own distorted body image.},

Here, we describe several recent experimental examples of BSSM, wherein exposure to “extreme” body stimuli causes visual aftereffects of biased perception.

The sensory inputs involved in posture control include visual and vestibular inputs, as well as proprioceptive and tactile somatosensory inputs. These multisensory inputs are integrated to represent the body state (body schema); this is then utilized in the brain to generate the motion. Changes in the multisensory inputs result in postural alterations (fast dynamics), as well as long-term alterations in multisensory integration and posture control itself (slow dynamics). In this review, we discuss the fast and slow dynamics, with a focus on multisensory integration including an introduction of our study to investigate “internal force control” with multisensory integration-evoked posture alteration. We found that the study of the slow dynamics is lagging compared to that of fast dynamics, such that our understanding of long-term alterations is insufﬁcient to reveal the underlying mechanisms and to propose suitable models. Additional studies investigating slow dynamics are required to expand our knowledge of this area, which would support the physical training and rehabilitation of elderly and impaired persons.},

We show that the same result can be reproduced by sampling selectively from a single distribution of performance in body size judgement by comparing low BMI individuals with normal BMI individuals. Over-estimation of body size in AN is not necessarily pathological and can be predicted by normal psychophysical biases in magnitude estimation. We conﬁrm this prediction in a dataset from a morphing study in which 30 women with AN and 137 control women altered a photograph of themselves to estimate their actual body size. We further investigated the relative contributions of sensory and attitudinal factors to body-size overestimation in a sample of 166 women. Our results suggest that both factors play a role, but their relative importance is task dependent.},

	abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the inﬂuence of personal BMI on body size estimation in 42 women who have symptoms of anorexia (referred to henceforth as anorexia spectrum disorders, ANSD), and 100 healthy controls. Low BMI control participants over-estimate their size and high BMI controls under-estimate, a pattern which is predicted by a perceptual phenomenon called contraction bias. In addition, control participants’ sensitivity to size change declines as their BMI increases as predicted by Weber’s law. The responses of women with ANSD are very different. Low BMI participants who have ANSD are extremely accurate at estimating body size and are very sensitive to changes in body size in this BMI range. However, as BMI rises in the ANSD participant group, there is a rapid increase in overestimation concurrent with a rapid decline in sensitivity to size change. We discuss the results in the context of signal detection theory.},

Forty women, with no history of eating disorders, carried out the experiment. Each participant carried out ﬁve adaptation blocks, with adapting stimuli representing female bodies at: extreme-low body mass index (BMI), mid-low BMI, actual BMI of the observer, mid-high BMI, and extreme-high BMI. Block order was randomized across participants. The main outcome variable was percentage error in participants’ self-estimates of body size, measured post-adaption. In regressions of this percentage error on the strength of the adapting stimuli together with observers’ attitudinal body image as a covariate, we found positive regression slopes and no evidence for any interaction between the ﬁxed effects. Therefore, we conclude that perceptual and attitudinal body image mechanisms are indeed independent of each other. In the light of this evidence, we discuss how people with eating disorders, like anorexia nervosa, may come to over-estimate their body size.},

The second aim was to investigate the relationship between body ﬁgure evaluations, eating disorder symptoms and mood. A Modiﬁed Affective Priming Test was used to measure implicit evaluations of body silhouettes, while a Likert scale was used to assess explicit evaluations. The study involved 35 women with restrictive anorexia nervosa and 35 age- and education-level-matched controls with normal body weight. In contrast to the control group, the patients did not show a positive attitude toward the ultra-thin body shape on the automatic level. The AN group both on the automatic and the self-reported levels evaluated the overweight body as negative. Depression and anxiety did not inﬂuence body evaluation. Strong negative evaluation of overweight appears to be a key issue in AN rather than positive evaluation of ultrathin role models.},

While the DMN is important for such processes, it has functions other than self-reference, and self-referential processes are supported by regions outside of the DMN. In our study of 88 participants, we examined self-referential and resting-state processes to clarify the extent to which DMN activity was common and distinct between the conditions. Within areas commonly activated by self-reference and rest we sought to identify those that showed additional functional specialization for self-referential processes: these being not only activated by self-reference and rest but also showing increased activity in self-reference versus rest. We examined the neural network properties of the identiﬁed ‘core-self’ DMN regions—in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and inferior parietal lobule—using dynamic causal modeling. The optimal model identiﬁed was one in which self-related processes were driven via PCC activity and moderated by the regulatory inﬂuences of MPFC. We thus conﬁrm the signiﬁcance of these regions for self-related processes and extend our understanding of their functionally specialized roles.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured activation following presentation to the blind hemi¢eld of whole body images (happy, neutral) with the face blurred. Unseen happy body images selectively activated area MT and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, while unseen instrumental neutral body images activated the premotor cortex.

To account for such variety, there is a growing consensus that there are at least two distinct types of body representation that can be impaired, the body schema and the body image. However, the deﬁnition of these notions is often unclear. The notion of body image has attracted most controversy because of its lack of unifying positive deﬁnition. The notion of body schema, onto which there seems to be a more widespread agreement, also covers a variety of sensorimotor representations. Here, I provide a conceptual analysis of the body schema contrasting it with the body image(s) as well as assess whether (i) the body schema can be speciﬁcally impaired, while other types of body representation are preserved; and (ii) the body schema obeys principles that are different from those that apply to other types of body representation.},

	abstract = {We designed a semi-structured questionnaire for the introspective evaluation of inner experience of participants undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the resting state. This resting state questionnaire (ReSQ) consists of 62 items organized by ﬁve main types of mental activity: visual mental imagery (IMAG); inner language (LANG), split into two subtypes, inner speech (SPEE) and auditory mental imagery (AUDI); somatosensory awareness (SOMA); inner musical experience (MUSI); and mental manipulation of numbers (NUMB). For IMAG and LANG, additional questions estimated association of such activities with ongoing learning, retrospective memories, or prospective thoughts. Using a 0–100\% scale, the participant quantitatively rated the proportion of time spent in each mental activity during the resting state fMRI acquisition. A total of 180 healthy volunteers completed the ReSQ immediately after being scanned with fMRI while at rest. Of these, 66\% exhibited dominance of a type of mental activity at rest (IMAG: 35\%; LANG: 17\%; SOMA: 7\%; MUSI: 6\%; NUMB: 1\%). A majority of participants reported either retrospective memories (82\%) or prospective thoughts (78\%), with 58\% of participants reporting both in at least one type of mental activity. Thoughts related to ongoing learning were low (37\% of participants). The present results are consistent with those of previous studies investigating inner experience in a natural environment. In conclusion, we provide a robust and easy-to-implement tool for the exploration of mental activities during rest of healthy participants undergoing fMRI. This tool relies on normative data acquired from a 180-participant sample balanced for sex and handedness.},

We used the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to draw the location of the ‘self’ away from the body, towards extracorporeal space (Out Condition), thereby violating top-down information about the body location. This was compared with the traditional RHI which drew position of the ‘self’ towards the body (In Condition). We were successfully able to draw proprioceptive position of the limbs in and out from the body suggesting body perception is a purely bottom-up process, resistant to top-down effects. Conversely, we found subjective self-representation was altered by the violation of top-down body information – as the strong association of subjective and proprioceptive factors found in the In Condition became non-signiﬁcant in the Out Condition. Interestingly, we also found evidence that subjective embodiment can modulate tactile perception.},

	abstract = {Perception of others' bodies provides information that is useful for a number of important social-cognitive processes. Evidence from neuroimaging methods has identiﬁed focal cortical regions that are highly selective for perceiving bodies and body parts, including the extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform body area (FBA). Our understanding of the functional properties of these regions, and their causal contributions to behavior, has beneﬁtted from the study of neuropsychological patients and particularly from investigations using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We review this evidence, focusing on TMS studies that are revealing of how (and when) activity in EBA contributes to detecting people in natural scenes; to resolving their body shape, movements, actions, individual parts, and identities; and to guiding goal-directed behavior. These ﬁndings are considered in reference to a framework for body perception in which the patterns of neural activity in EBA and FBA jointly serve to make explicit the elements of the visual scene that correspond to the body and its parts. These representations are modulated by other sources of information such as prior knowledge, and are shared with wider brain networks involved in many aspects of social cognition.},

Science, 293(5539), 2470– 2473.) have recently been described using fMRI. A parallel body of research has focused on the ability of faces to “capture” the focus of attention, compared to other kinds of objects (Lavie, N., Ro, T., \& Russell, C. (2003).

The present study uses Mack and Rock’s “inattentional blindness” paradigm to investigate whether unexpected, task-irrelevant human body stimuli capture awareness when attention is occupied by a primary task (Mack, A., \& Rock, I. (1998). Inattentional blindness. London: MIT Press). Silhouettes and stick ﬁgures of human bodies, and silhouettes of hands, were compared to control stimuli including object silhouettes, object stick ﬁgures, and scrambled silhouettes of bodies, body parts, and objects. Participants were signiﬁcantly better able to detect a human ﬁgure relative to the control stimuli. These results suggest that the human body, like the face, may be prioritized for attentional selection. More generally, they are consistent with the proposal that the visual system assigns attentional priority to types of stimuli that are also represented in strongly selective cortical regions.},

The present study investigated the impact of sensitivity to internal signals, that is, interoceptive awareness, on interindividual differences in cognitive and emotional aspects of body experience. Subjects with accurate (n = 30) versus poor (n = 30) interoceptive awareness, classified via a heartbeat perception task, completed the Body Consciousness Questionnaire and the Body Appraisal Inventory. Possible effects of emotional state on body experience were controlled for using measures of mood and anxiety. While the groups did not differ in their emotional state, individuals with accurate cardiac interoceptive awareness exhibited higher subjective sensitivity to bodily sensations and a more positive body image, characterized by stronger body-related self-confidence, greater satisfaction with physical appearance, greater perceived bodily self-control, as well as reduced hypochondriacal concerns, sexual discontent, and shame. The present findings extend earlier research on the importance of perception of physical cues for emotion, cognition, and behavior regulation. Our results underline the contribution of interoceptive information to body experience, where interindividual differences in the accessibility of such information modulate cognitive and affective facets of body image.},

	abstract = {Background. The importance of assessing proprioceptive function for rehabilitation after neurological or orthopedic injury has long been recognized. Yet, neither the validity nor the accuracy of the available tests is ﬁrmly established. Testing typically involves repeated matching of a given joint position with the same or opposite limb where the difference between the 2 positions indicates proprioceptive acuity.
Objectives. The aim of this study was to compare position sense acuity between ipsilateral and contralateral matching methods against a psychophysical threshold method to establish the accuracy and relationships between these models. Design. A repeated-measures design was used. N. Elangovan, PT, MS, Human Sensorimotor Control Laboratory, Center for Clinical Movement Science and School of Kinesiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. A. Herrmann, MS, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina. At the time of the study, Ms Herrmann was afﬁliated with the Human Sensorimotor Control Laboratory, Center for Clinical Movement Science and School of Kinesiology, University of Minnesota.
Method. Assessment of forearm position sense for a 10-degree reference position in 27 young adults who were healthy.
Results. Psychophysical thresholds were revealed to be the most precise and least variable acuity measure. The mean (ϮSD) threshold (1.05°Ϯ0.47°) was signiﬁcantly lower than mean position errors obtained by both joint position matching tasks (ipsilateral: 1.51°Ϯ0.64°; contralateral: 1.84°Ϯ0.73°)—a 44\% to 75\% difference in measurement accuracy. Individual participant position errors correlated poorly with respective thresholds, indicating a lack of concurrent validity. Position errors for both matching methods correlated only mildly with each other. Limitations. The data represent performance of a healthy, young adult cohort. Differences between methods will likely be more pronounced in aging and clinical populations.
Conclusions. Threshold testing and joint position matching methods examine different physiological aspects of proprioceptive function. Because threshold testing is based on passive motion, it most closely reﬂects afferent sensory feedback processing (ie, proprioception). Matching methods require active motion and are consequently inﬂuenced by additional sensorimotor processes. Factors such as working memory and transmission between brain hemispheres also inﬂuence joint matching task outcomes.},

The relationships between IS and self-reported body awareness, and between body image dissatisfaction and BMI were uniformly non-signiﬁcant in both samples. Predictors of body image dissatisfaction were resting heart rate, gender, and IS in the regression analysis after controlling for BMI, age, and nationality.

The aim of the present study was to extend the use of the RHI to examine the bodily self in eating disorders. Methods: The RHI and self-report measures of eating disorder psychopathology (EDI-3 subscales of Drive for Thinness, Bulimia, Body Dissatisfaction, Interoceptive Deficits, and Emotional Dysregulation; DASS-21; and the Self-Objectification Questionnaire) were administered to 78 individuals with an eating disorder and 61 healthy controls. Results: Individuals with an eating disorder experienced the RHI significantly more strongly than healthy controls on both perceptual (i.e., proprioceptive drift) and subjective (self-report questionnaire) measures. Furthermore, both the subjective experience of the RHI and associated proprioceptive biases were correlated with eating disorder psychopathology. Approximately 20\% of the variance for embodiment of the fake hand was accounted for by eating disorder psychopathology, with interoceptive deficits and self-objectification significant predictors of embodiment. Conclusions: These results indicate that the bodily self is more plastic in people with an eating disorder. These findings may shed light on both aetiological and maintenance factors involved in eating disorders, particularly visual processing of the body, interoceptive deficits, and self-objectification.},

Paralleling this phenomenon, observing emotional states (including pain) in others is associated with activity in the same brain areas as activated when experiencing similar emotions directly. This emotion perception associated activity has been shown to be affected by the perceived fairness of the actor, and in-group membership more generally. Here, we examine whether action observation associated brain activity is also affected by the perceived social fairness of the actors. Perceived fairness was manipulated using an alternating iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game between the participant and two confederates, one of whom played fairly and the other unfairly. During fMRI scanning the participants watched movies of the confederates performing object-directed hand actions, and then performed hand actions themselves. Massunivariate analysis showed that observing the actions triggered robust activation in regions associated with action execution, but failed to identify a strong modulation of this activation based on perceived fairness. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, identified clusters potentially carrying information about the perceived fairness of the actor in the middle temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, right middle cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus, and right superioroccipital gyrus. Despite being identified by a wholebrain searchlight analysis (and so without anatomical restriction), these clusters fall into areas frequently associated with action observation. We conclude that brain activity during action observation may be modulated by perceived fairness, but such modulation is subtle; robust activity is associated with observing the actions of both fair and unfair individuals.},

	abstract = {Background: Although body image disturbance is considered one of the core characteristics of anorexia nervosa (AN), the exact nature of this complex feature is poorly understood. Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies can only partially explore the multimodal complexity of body consciousness, which is a complex cognition underpinned by aspects of visual perception, proprioception, and touch. The aim of the present study was to explore the functional connectivity of networks involved in visuospatial and somatosensory processing in AN.
Methods: Twenty-nine subjects with AN, 16 women who had recovered from it, and 26 healthy women underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan and neuropsychological assessment of their visuospatial abilities using the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test.
Results: Both AN groups showed areas of decreased connectivity in the ventral visual network, a network involved in the “what?” pathway of visual perception. Even more interestingly, the AN group, but not the recovered AN group, displayed increased coactivation in the left parietal cortex, encompassing the somatosensory cortex, in an area implicated in long-term multimodal spatial memory and representation, even in the absence of visual information. A neuropsychological assessment of visuospatial abilities revealed that aspects of detail processing and global integration (central coherence) showed correlations with connectivity of this brain area in the AN group.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings show that AN is associated with double disruption of brain connectivity, which shows a speciﬁc association with visuospatial difﬁculties and may explain the failure of the integration process between visual and somatosensory perceptual information that might sustain body image disturbance.},

Psychological states can affect balance control: anxiety, in particular, has been shown to inﬂuence balance mediated by visual stimuli. We hypothesized that patients with eating disorders would show postural destabilization when exposed to their image in a mirror and to the image of a fashion model representing their body ideal in comparison to body neutral stimuli. Seventeen females patients attending a day centre for the treatment of eating disorders were administered psychometric measures of body dissatisfaction, anxiety, depression and underwent posturographic measures with their eyes closed, open, watching a neutral stimulus, while exposed to a full length mirror and to an image of a fashion model corresponding to their body image. Results were compared to those obtained by eighteen healthy subjects. Eating disordered patients showed higher levels of body dissatisfaction and higher postural destabilization than controls, but this was limited to the conditions in which they were exposed to their mirror image or a fashion model image. Postural destabilization under these conditions correlated with measures of body dissatisfaction. In eating disordered patients, body related stimuli seem to act as phobic stimuli in the posturographic paradigm used. If conﬁrmed, this has the potential to be developed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the association between the perception of body weight (as above or below the desired) and behaviors for body weight control in adolescents.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that included 1051 adolescents (aged 15---19 years) who were high school students attending public schools. The authors collected information on the perception of body weight (dependent variable), weight control behaviors (initiative to change the weight, physical exercise, eating less or cutting calories, fasting for 24 h, taking medications, vomiting, or taking laxatives), and measured body weight and height to calculate the body mass index and then classify the weight status. Associations were tested by multinomial logistic regression analysis.
Results: Adolescents of both sexes who perceived their body weight as below the expected weight took more initiatives to gain weight, and those who perceived themselves as overweight made more efforts to lose weight. In adolescents who perceived themselves as overweight, the behavior of not taking medication was associated with the outcome only in boys (Odds Ratio = 8.12), whereas in girls, an association was observed with the variables eating less, cutting calories, or avoiding fatty foods aiming to lose or avoid increasing body weight (Odds Ratio = 3.39). Adolescents of both sexes who practiced exercises were more likely to perceive themselves as overweight (male Odds Ratio = 2.00; Odds Ratio = 1.93 female).
Conclusion: The perception of the body weight as above and below one’s expected weight was associated with weight control behaviors, which were more likely to result in initiatives to lose and gain weight, respectively.},

This study has investigated self-other body-shape comparison to establish neural correlates of body dissatisfaction in patients with AN. 17 women with AN and 18 age and sex-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while comparing themselves with images of slim idealized female bodies (active condition) or viewing images of interior home designs (control condition).

	abstract = {Distortions of body image have often been investigated in clinical disorders. Much of this literature implicitly assumes healthy adults maintain an accurate body image. We recently developed a novel, implicit, and quantitative measure of body image — the Body Image Task (BIT). Here, we report a large-scale analysis of performance on this task by healthy adults. In both an in-person and an online version of the BIT, participants were presented with an image of a head as an anchoring stimulus on a computer screen, and told to imagine that the head was part of a mirror image of themselves in a standing position. They were then instructed to judge where, relative to the head, each of several parts of their body would be located. The relative positions of each landmark can be used to construct an implicit perceptual map of bodily structure. We could thus measure the internally-stored body image, although we cannot exclude contributions from other representations. Our results show several distortions of body image. First, we found a large and systematic over-estimation of width relative to height. These distortions were similar for both males and females, and did not closely track the idiosyncrasies of individual participant's own bodies. Comparisons of individual body parts showed that participants overestimated the width of their shoulders and the length of their upper arms, relative to their height, while underestimating the lengths of their lower arms and legs. Principal components analysis showed a clear spatial structure to the distortions, suggesting spatial organisation and segmentation of the body image into upper and lower limb components that are bilaterally integrated. These results provide new insight into the body image of healthy adults, and have implications for the study and rehabilitation of clinical populations.},

This hypothesis posits a representation that tracks changes in the spatial content of the body and supplies this content to other body representations. I argue that a similar kind of body representation might exist and, in the case of anorexia, be distorted. Finally, I suggest that this body representation might become distorted through inﬂuence by affect.},

Within this emerging literature, Pitron and colleagues (2018) proposed that the long-term body image and long-term body schema co-construct one another, through a process of reciprocal interaction. In proposing this model, they make two assumptions: that the long-term body image incorporates the spatial characteristics of tools, and that it is distorted in the case of Alice in wonderland syndrome. Here, I challenge these assumptions, with a closer examination of what the term “long-term body image” refers to.

	abstract = {Affective states, anxiety in particular, have been shown to negatively inﬂuence human postural control efﬁciency as measured by posturographic means, while exposure to a full-length mirror image of one’s body exerts a stabilizing effect. We tested the hypothesis that body image concerns and preoccupations would relate negatively to this stabilising effect. Sixty-six healthy students, who screened negative for psychiatric disorders, completed rating scales for anxiety, depression and body image concerns. Posturography recordings of body sway were taken under three conditions: with eyes closed, looking at a vertical bar and looking at a full-length mirror. The Eyes Open/Mirror Stabilometric Quotient [EOMQ = (sway path with eyes closed/sway path looking at the mirror) × 100], an index of how much postural control is stabilized by mirror feedback in comparison to the visual vertical bar condition, was signiﬁcantly inversely related to body image concerns and preoccupations, and to trait anxiety. This ﬁnding conﬁrms the impact of emotional factors on human postural control, which warrant further studies. If conﬁrmed in clinical populations characterized by high levels of body image disturbances, e.g. eating disorders, it could lead to developments in the assessment and monitoring of these patients. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The liberal view, defended here, considers cognition to be socially extensive, in a way that goes beyond the typical examples (involving notebooks and various technologies) rehearsed in the extended mind literature, and in a way that takes cognition to involve enactive processes (e.g., social aﬀordances), rather than functional supervenience relations. The socially extended mind is in some cases constituted not only in social interactions with others, but also in ways that involve institutional structures, norms, and practices. Some of the common objections to the extended mind are considered in relation to this liberal interpretation. Implications for critical social theory are explored.},

	abstract = {Witnessing another person’s suffering elicits vicarious brain activity in areas that are active when we ourselves are in pain. Whether this activity influences prosocial behavior remains the subject of debate. Here participants witnessed a confederate express pain through a reaction of the swatted hand or through a facial expression, and could decide to reduce that pain by donating money. Participants donate more money on trials in which the confederate expressed more pain. Electroencephalography shows that activity of the somatosensory cortex I (SI) hand region explains variance in donation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) shows that altering this activity interferes with the pain–donation coupling only when pain is expressed by the hand. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) shows that altering SI activity also interferes with pain perception. These experiments show that vicarious somatosensory activations contribute to prosocial decision-making and suggest that they do so by helping to transform observed reactions of affected body-parts into accurate perceptions of pain that are necessary for decision-making.
          , 
            When we experience physical pain, certain areas in our brain that process bodily sensation and emotions switch on. If we see someone else in pain, many of the same regions also get activated. In contrast, convicted criminals with psychopathic traits have less activation in these areas of the brain when witnessing someone’s pain; they also show less empathy and disregard the needs of others. This suggests that a lack of this ‘shared activations’ may lead to problems in empathy. In fact, many scientists believe that shared activations are why we feel empathy for people in pain, and why we are driven to help them. Yet, there is little direct evidence about how the activity in the pain processing parts of the brain actually influences helpful behavior. As a result, some scientists now argue that empathy-related processes may actually contribute very little to helping behavior.
            Gallo et al. designed an experiment where participants watched videos of someone having their hand swatted with a belt, and showing different levels of pain as a result. The volunteers could decide to reduce the amount of pain the person received by donating money they could have taken home. The more pain the participants thought the victim was in, the more money they gave up to lessen it. During the study, the activity in the brain region that processes pain in the hand was also measured in the participants. The more active this region was, the more money people donated to help.
            Then, Gallo et al. used techniques that interfered with the activity of the brain area involved in perceiving sensations from the hand. This interference changed how accurately participants assessed the victim's pain. It also disrupted the link between donations and the victim's perceived pain: the amount of money people gave no longer matched the level of pain they had witnessed. This suggests that the brain areas that perceive sensations of pain in the self, which evolved primarily to experience our own sensations, also have a social function. They transform the sight of bodily harm into an accurate feeling for how much pain the victim experiences. The findings also show that we need this feeling so we can adapt our help to the needs of others. In the current debate about the role of empathy in helping behaviors, this study demonstrates that empathy-related brain activity indeed promotes helping by allowing us to detect those that need our assistance.
            Understanding the relationship between helping behavior and the activity of the brain may further lead to treatments for individuals with antisocial behavior and for children with callous and unemotional traits, a disorder that is associated with a lack of empathy and a general disregard for others.},

	abstract = {Recent research has shown that proprioception relies on distorted representations of body size and shape. By asking participants to localise multiple landmarks on their occluded hand, perceptual maps of hand size and shape can be constructed and compared to actual hand structure. These maps are different from the actual size and shape of the occluded hand, revealing underestimation of ﬁnger length and overestimation of hand width. Here we tested whether the same distorted body model underlies proprioceptive imagery (i.e. imagining the hand at a speciﬁc location, and in a different posture than it actually is). In Experiment 1, participants placed their left hand under an occluding board (real condition) or imagined their left hand under the board (imagined condition). Highly similar distortions were found in both conditions. Furthermore, results across the two conditions were strongly correlated. In Experiment 2, participants completed the real condition and two imagined conditions. In the imagined-ﬁst condition, participants held their left hand in a ﬁst, in their lap, while in the imagined-ﬂat condition, participants held their left hand ﬂat, with palm down, in their lap. In both imagined conditions, participants were asked to imagine their left hand lying ﬂat, with palm down, under the occluding board. A similar pattern of distortions was found in all three conditions. These results suggest that both proprioception and proprioceptive imagery reply on a common stored model of the body’s metric properties.},

	abstract = {Body image distress or body dissatisfaction is one of the most common consequences of obesity and overweight. We investigated the neural bases of body image processing in overweight and average weight young women to understand whether brain regions that were previously found to be involved in processing self-reflective, perspective and affective components of body image would show different activation between two groups. Thirteen overweight (O-W group, age = 20.31±1.70 years) and thirteen average weight (A-W group, age = 20.15±1.62 years) young women underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a body image self-reflection task. Among both groups, whole-brain analysis revealed activations of a brain network related to perceptive and affective components of body image processing. ROI analysis showed a main effect of group in ACC as well as a group by condition interaction within bilateral EBA, bilateral FBA, right IPL, bilateral DLPFC, left amygdala and left MPFC. For the A-W group, simple effect analysis revealed stronger activations in Thin-Control compared to Fat-Control condition within regions related to perceptive (including bilateral EBA, bilateral FBA, right IPL) and affective components of body image processing (including bilateral DLPFC, left amygdala), as well as self-reference (left MPFC). The O-W group only showed stronger activations in Fat-Control than in Thin-Control condition within regions related to the perceptive component of body image processing (including left EBA and left FBA). Path analysis showed that in the Fat-Thin contrast, body dissatisfaction completely mediated the group difference in brain response in left amygdala across the whole sample. Our data are the first to demonstrate differences in brain response to body pictures between average weight and overweight young females involved in a body image self-reflection task. These results provide insights for understanding the vulnerability to body image distress among overweight or obese young females.},

The most recent review (Farrell et al., 2005) found that only half the studies reported overestimation of body size in individuals diagnosed with AN. The remaining studies found no overestimation or in some instances underestimation. The discrepancy in these ﬁndings has been attributed to the wide variety of assessment techniques that are used, including many with questionable psychometric properties. We review all 9 contemporary studies conducted in this area since the last review in 2005. For each study we describe the number of participants, methodology, reliability/validity data, amount of whole body distortion, effect sizes, and a summary of ﬁndings. In all studies that included a healthy control group, individuals with AN overestimated their whole body size more than healthy controls did. The difference was signiﬁcant in all except two studies. Based on these contemporary ﬁndings, we conclude that individuals with AN overestimate their body size and that the greater consistency of ﬁndings in the studies conducted over the last decade is attributable to the use of improved methodologies and assessment tools with documented psychometric properties.},

However, behavioural research considers such symptom as a multidimensional construct. Our paper systematically reviews the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies on body image distortion in AN and classiﬁes them according to a speculative model of body image distortion, that consists of the three most widely accepted components in the behavioural research: perceptive, affective and cognitive. We found that: (1) the perceptive component is mainly related to alterations of the precuneus and the inferior parietal lobe; (2) the affective component is mainly related to alterations of the prefrontal cortex, the insula and the amygdala; (3) the cognitive component has been weakly explored. These evidences seem to conﬁrm that speciﬁc neural alterations are related to the components of the body image distortion in AN. Further neuroimaging studies are needed to better understand the complexity of the body image distortion in AN.},

	abstract = {Background: Body image distortion is a central symptom of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Even if corporeal awareness is multisensory majority of AN studies mainly investigated visual misperception. We systematically reviewed AN studies that have investigated different nonvisual sensory inputs using an integrative multisensory approach to body perception. We also discussed the findings in the light of AN neuroimaging evidence.
Methods: PubMed and PsycINFO were searched until March, 2014. To be included in the review, studies were mainly required to: investigate a sample of patients with current or past AN and a control group and use tasks that directly elicited one or more nonvisual sensory domains.
Results: Thirteen studies were included. They studied a total of 223 people with current or past AN and 273 control subjects. Overall, results show impairment in tactile and proprioceptive domains of body perception in AN patients. Interoception and multisensory integration have been poorly explored directly in AN patients. A limitation of this review is the relatively small amount of literature available.
Conclusions: Our results showed that AN patients had a multisensory impairment of body perception that goes beyond visual misperception and involves tactile and proprioceptive sensory components. Furthermore, impairment of tactile and proprioceptive components may be associated with parietal cortex alterations in AN patients. Interoception and multisensory integration have been weakly explored directly. Further research, using multisensory approaches as well as neuroimaging techniques, is needed to better define the complexity of body image distortion in AN.},

	abstract = {Background: Physical activity (PA) is associated with positive health outcomes, whereas physical inactivity is related to an increased risk for various health issues including obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Previous research indicates that interindividual differences in the perception of bodily processes (interoceptive sensitivity, IS) interact with the degree of PA in adults. Whether there is a similar relationship between PA and IS in children has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between IS and PA during physical performance tasks and in everyday situations. Methods: IS was assessed using a heartbeat perception task in a sample of 49 children within the health promotion program “Join the Healthy Boat” which is implemented in several primary schools in the southwest of Germany. PA was examined using a physical performance task, assessing the distance covered during a standardized 6-min run. In a subsample of 21 children, everyday PA was measured by a multi-sensor device (Actiheart, CamNtech, Cambridge, UK) during five consecutive days with more than 10 h of daily data collection. Results: Children with higher IS performed better in the physical performance task. Additionally, based on energy expenditure defined as metabolic equivalents, IS was positively correlated with the extent of light PA levels in the morning and afternoon. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that IS interacts positively with the degree of PA in children supporting the idea that interoception is important for the self-regulation of health-related behavior.},

	abstract = {Some researchers have argued that evaluative body image may be better assessed by measures that weight dissatisfaction–satisfaction ratings by their subjective importance to individuals. The Body Areas Satisfaction Scale (BASS) is a frequently used, standardized assessment of evaluative body image, albeit one that does not use differential item weights. This investigation, with 410 female and male college students, examined whether an importance-weighted revision of the BASS would have incremental validity relative to the original version in the prediction of multiple criterion variables. Results conﬁrmed the reliability and validity of unweighted and weighted versions. However, the validity of weighted versions did not surpass that of the original BASS. The extremity of individuals’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction ratings appears inherently to reﬂect the importance placed on physical attributes for self-evaluation. Moderated regression analyses offered only weak support for the interaction of average satisfaction and average importance ratings beyond their main effects. The simpler, unweighted BASS is an acceptable assessment of evaluative body image.},

	abstract = {Body image disturbance is a core characteristic of anorexia nervosa, which might be grounded in distortions in schematic body representations. In line with this, several studies showed that when walking through door-like apertures of different widths, individuals with anorexia nervosa move as if their bodies are larger than they actually are. They turn their body at a higher aperture/shoulder width ratio than healthy individuals. We examined whether oversized body-scaled motoric behaviors may not be restricted to anorexia nervosa but concern a general feature of negative body image attitudes. Therefore, we investigated the relation between negative body image as assessed with shape and weight concerns subscales of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and aperture/ shoulder width turning ratios in women with a healthy weight (n = 62). We found that a more negative body image was unrelated to higher aperture/shoulder width turning ratios. Bayes analysis provided moderate evidence for the null hypothesis that spontaneous body-scaled motoric behaviors are not involved in negative body image. Future studies should disentangle whether being underweight per se is related to distinctive spontaneous body-scaled motoric behaviors or whether an “oversized” body schema is a unique characteristic of anorexia nervosa, potentially contributing to the persistence of this disorder.},

Is this over-estimation speciﬁc to women with AN’s judgments of their own body? Or is it just a general feature of their judgments about all bodies? If the latter, it would be consistent with a general error in the perception of body size potentially linked to the use of a different set of visual cues for judging body size. If the former, then this suggests that the over-estimation of own body size has a strong attitudinal component and may be part of the psycho-pathology of their condition. To test this hypothesis, 20 women with AN and 80 control observers estimated the body size of 46 women. The results show a strong effect of perceptual factors in estimating body size for both controls and women with AN. This result is consistent with size over-estimation of own body in AN having a strong attitudinal basis and being a core feature of the psycho-pathology of the condition.},

	abstract = {Background: In anorexia nervosa (AN), taste and smell are believed to be anhedonic, hunger and pain are muted, and body-image distortion obscures wasting, which together facilitate self-starvation. However, the emphasis on these deﬁcits may be biased because other sensory systems have been sparsely investigated.
Objectives: Objectives of the study were to clarify whether these dysfunctions are speciﬁc or part of a pattern of sensory-perceptual deﬁcits in AN patients and to test the gustatory senses dissociated from ingestion to clarify whether any deﬁcit is sensory or affective. Design: In 15 adolescent, ﬁrst-episode, hospitalized, restrictive AN patients and 15 matched healthy controls who responded to gustatory stimuli (intensity and hedonics of 5 basic tastes and tastes and odors of foods and nonfoods), size estimation (manual and oral judgment of size and shape, kinesthesia, and body size and esthetics), cold pain, and auditory and visual processing were compared.
Results: AN patients did not differ on most tests, were better at odor recognition, were less successful in central auditory processing and oral assessment of size and shape, and may have been more sensitive to cold. Body-image dissatisfaction in AN patients was not related to dysfunctional size estimation.
Conclusions: There is no systematic sensory-perceptual deﬁcit in AN patients, and speciﬁcally, not in gustatory function. The few differences shown might be due to fear of food-related stimuli or comorbidity. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;95:272–82.},

A total of 202 adults (84 men and 118 women) with a mean age of 34.9 years adjusted the size of each part of a comparison silhouette until it matched that of a sample silhouette. The sensitivity to detect subtle differences was greater for the male than for the female silhouette (mean Weber Fractions, WF = .032, .036, respectively). The greatest sensitivity for both silhouettes was in the waist and hips (WF = .019 in both cases) and the smallest in the arms and face (WF = .048, .049, respectively). Men, young participants and those with high education (WF between .017 and .043) detected subtle differences to a greater degree than their counterparts (WF between .019 and .053). According to the environmental approach of social psychology, the latter suggests that members of those subgroups have been subjected to more social pressures to sharpen their discrimination of small differences in the body shape of their conspeciﬁcs.

	abstract = {Objective: Our goal was to investigate whether patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) show deficits in haptic exploration tasks before and after weight gain. Method: The haptic exploration tasks consisted of palpating the structure of six sunken reliefs in sequence with both hands, eyes closed. After each exploration, the structure was reproduced on a piece of paper. A 19-channel digital electroencephalogram (EEG; linked ears) was continuously recorded during rest and haptic tasks for 10 AN patients (females, mean age: 15.90) and 10 healthy controls (CO; females, mean age: 16.14). Mean spectral power density was calculated as the mean amplitude of the spectral lines of the theta band (4–8 Hz). The AN patients were examined again after weight gain (T0 and T1). Results: The reproductions submitted by the AN patients were of notably poorer quality than those of the CO. Reproduction quality was unchanged after weight gain and independent of body mass index and intelligence. Mean exploration time was similiar in AN patients and CO. The analysis of spectral EEG power of both groups showed significant decrease in power data in the theta frequency band during haptic exploration compared with the rest intervals. The comparison of the theta power between CO and AN patients during haptic exploration showed major differences between the groups in both T0 and T1. Theta power was lower in AN patients than in the CO over the right hemisphere and right parietal regions. Discussion: The quality of reproduction of the haptic stimuli and the theta-power changes indicate a cortical dysfunction and deficits in somatosensory integration processing of the right parietal cortex in AN patients even after weight gain. © 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

As far as DTIM assessment of body dissatisfaction was con­ cerned, adolescents showed no significantly greater aesthetic preoccupation than subjects of other age groups. On the other hand, using BCS, body dissatisfaction appeared to increase proportionally with age. The low, although significant, correla­ tions between these two techniques of measuring body dissat­ isfaction suggest that, in addition to evaluating aesthetic fea­ tures, BCS also assesses the degree of satisfaction with func­ tional body aspects which are exposed to unavoidable decline with ageing.},

The precise nature of this bias is not known: is it a false belief related to the patient’s aesthetic and emotional attitudes towards her body? Or could it also reﬂect abnormal processing of the representation of the body in action? We tested this latter hypothesis by using a body-scaled action-anticipation task in which 25 anorexics and 25 control participants had to judge whether or not an aperture was wide enough for them to pass through. The anticipation of body-scaled action was severely disturbed in anorexic patients; they judged that they could not pass through an aperture, even when it was wide enough (i.e. they behave as if their body was larger than in reality). The abnormally high “passability ratio” (the critical aperture size to shoulder width ratio) was also correlated with the duration of illness and the degree of body concern/dissatisfaction. Our results suggest that body size overestimation in anorexia nervosa is not solely due to psycho-affective factors but rather suggest impaired neural processing of body dimensions that might take its source in parietal networks.},

	abstract = {In anorexia nervosa (AN), body distortions have been associated with parietal cortex (PC) dysfunction. The PC is the anatomical substrate for a supramodal reference framework involved in spatial orientation constancy. Here, we sought to evaluate spatial orientation constancy and the perception of body orientation in AN patients. In the present study, we investigated the effect of passive lateral body inclination on the visual and tactile subjective vertical (SV) and body Z-axis in 25 AN patients and 25 healthy controls. Subjects performed visual- and tactile-spatial judgments of axis orientations in an upright position and tilted 90u clockwise or counterclockwise. We observed a significant deviation of the tactile and visual SV towards the body (an A-effect) under tilted conditions, suggesting a multisensory impairment in spatial orientation. Deviation of the Z-axis in the direction of the tilt was also observed in the AN group. The greater A-effect in AN patients may reflect reduced interoceptive awareness and thus inadequate consideration of gravitational inflow. Furthermore, marked body weight loss could decrease the somatosensory inputs required for spatial orientation. Our study results suggest that spatial references are impaired in AN. This may be due to particular integration of visual, tactile and gravitational information (e.g. vestibular and proprioceptive cues) in the PC.},

The current deﬁnition of motor imagery is widely accepted, but it is important to note that various abilities rather than a single cognitive entity are dealt with under a single term. Here, motor imagery has been characterized based on four factors: (1) motor control, (2) explicitness, (3) sensory modalities, and (4) agency. Sorting out these factors characterizing motor imagery may explain some discrepancies and variability in the ﬁndings from previous studies and will help to optimize a study design in accordance with the purpose of each study in the future.},

	abstract = {Objective: Perceiving internal signals of hunger and satiety is related to the regulation of food intake. Recent data suggest that interoception (perception of bodily signals) and interoceptive sensitivity (sensitivity for internal signals) might be a crucial variable for the regulation of behavior associated with feelings of satiety. It is yet unclear whether interoceptive sensitivity is altered in overweight and obese participants. Design and methods: We therefore examined interoceptive sensitivity among 75 overweight and obese women and men using a heartbeat detection task and compared them to normal weight controls. We hypothesized that overweight and obesity would be related to attenuated interoceptive sensitivity.
Results: Interoceptive sensitivity was higher in normal weight participants as compared to overweight and obese participants. Additionally, we found a negative correlation coefﬁcient between the BMI and interoceptive sensitivity in the overweight and obese group only.
Conclusions: In accordance with our hypotheses, we found evidence for reduced interoceptive sensitivity in overweight and obese individuals. Interoceptive sensitivity presumably interacts with the regulation of food intake in everyday life in part by facilitating the detection of bodily changes accompanying satiety. Overweight and obese individuals might experience greater difﬁculties in accurately detecting such signals due to reduced interoceptive sensitivity.},

The neurophysiology of subjective EA, among other mind-brain-body phenomena, can best be tested when subjects are stimulated in a natural fashion. Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables naturalistic experimental stimulation and thus promises to increase the ecological validity of research findings i.e., how well they generalize to real-life settings. In this study, 45 participants experienced virtual rollercoaster rides while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was then trained on the alpha-frequency (8-12 Hz) component of the EEG signal (input) and the retrospectively acquired continuous reports of subjective EA (target). With the LSTM-based model, subjective EA could be predicted significantly above chance level. This demonstrates a novel EEG-based decoding approach for subjective states of experience in naturalistic research designs using VR.},

Participants were recruited from 10 treatment centers in the United States and England and completed psychometrically validated and standardized self-report measures of body image. Overall, the AN, BN, and BDD groups were characterized by signiﬁcantly elevated disturbances in most body image dimensions relative to their gender-matched clinical controls. There was variability, however, in the comparisons among the three groups of interest, including foci of body dissatisfaction and body image coping patterns. On omnibus indices of body image disturbance and body image quality of life, patients with BDD reported more body image impairment than those with eating disorders. Although AN, BN, and BDD are characterized by body image disturbances, similar and partially distinctive cognitive, behavioral, and emotional elements of body image functioning exist among these groups.

	abstract = {Purpose: Body image incorporates cognitive and affective components as well as behaviors related to own body perception. This study evaluated the occurrence of body image distortion and its correlates in Korean adolescents.
Methods: In a school-based cross-sectional survey, a total of 2,117 adolescents were recruited. They filled out self-completing questionnaires on body image distortion, eating attitudes, and behaviors (Eating Attitude Test-26) and related factors.
Results: Body image distortions were found in 51.8 percent of adolescents. Univariate a­ nalyses showed that boys and older adolescents had higher rates of body image distortion. In the ­multivariate analyses, body image distortion was associated with high risk for eating disorders (odds ratio [OR] =1.69; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–2.58; P=0.015) and being over weight (OR =33.27; 95\% CI 15.51–71.35; P0.001) or obese (OR =9.37; 95\% CI 5.06–17.34; P0.001).
Conclusion: These results suggest that body image distortion is relatively common in Korean adolescents, which has implications for adolescents at risk of developing eating disorders.},

However, recent studies with eating disordered individuals have suggested that there may in fact be more interaction between these two representations than ﬁrst thought. We aimed to investigate how body image might act to inﬂuence body schema within a typical, healthy population. 100 healthy adult women were asked to judge the smallest gap between a pair of sliding doors that they could just pass through. We then determined whether these estimates were suﬃcient to predict the size of the smallest gap that they could actually pass through, or whether perceptual and attitudinal body image information was required in order to make these predictions. It was found that perceptual body image did indeed mediate performance on the egocentric (but not allocentric) motor imagery aﬀordance task, but only for those individuals with raised body image concerns and low self-esteem; body schema was inﬂuenced by both the perceptual and attitudinal components of body image in those with more negative bodily attitudes. Furthermore, disparities between perceived versus actual size were associated with body parts that had larger variations in adipose/muscle-dependent circumference. We therefore suggest that it may be the aﬀective salience of a distorted body representation that mediates the degree to which it is incorporated into the current body state.},

In this paradigm, parts of the stimuli are revealed by several randomly allocated Gaussian “windows” forcing judgements to be made based on this partial information. Over multiple trials, all potential cues are sampled, and the effectiveness of each window at predicting the judgement is determined. The modiﬁed bubbles strategy emphasises the distinction between central versus edge cues and localises the visual features used in judging one’s own body size. In addition, eye-movements were measured in conjunction with the bubbles paradigm and the results mapped onto a common reference space. This shows that although observers ﬁxate centrally on the torso, they are actually directing their visual attention to the edges of the torso to gauge body width as an index of body size. The central ﬁxations are simply the most efﬁcient way of positioning the eye to make this estimation. Inaccurate observers are less precise in their central ﬁxations and do not evenly allocate their attention to both sides of the torso’s edge, illustrating the importance of efﬁciently sampling the key information.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the proportion of normal-weight adolescents who consider themselves to be too heavy (size overestimation), and the proportion of overweight or obese adolescents who consider themselves to be about the right weight or too light (size underestimation), in large population-based samples collected over 8 years in England.
METHODS: Data were from the Health Survey for England between 2005 and 2012: an annual survey of households representative of the English population. We analysed data from 4979 adolescents (2668 boys, 2311 girls) aged 13 to 15 years old whose weight status was deﬁned as normal weight or overweight/obese based on body mass index standard deviation scores (BMI-SDS) derived from objective measurements of height and weight and using International Obesity Task Force standards. Weight perception was based on the adolescent’s choice from the following descriptors: ‘about the right weight’, ‘too heavy’ or ‘too light’.
RESULTS: The majority of normal-weight adolescents (83\% of boys, 84\% of girls) correctly identiﬁed themselves as ‘about the right weight’. Overestimation was uncommon, with only 7\% of normal-weight teens (4\% of boys, 11\% of girls) identifying themselves as ‘too heavy’. In contrast, only 60\% of overweight/obese adolescents (53\% of boys, 68\% of girls) correctly identiﬁed themselves as ‘too heavy’, whereas 39\% (47\% of boys, 32\% of girls) underestimated, identifying themselves as ‘about the right weight’ or ‘too light’. There were no signiﬁcant changes in BMI-SDS or body size estimation over time (2005–2012).
CONCLUSIONS: Overestimation of body weight among normal-weight adolescents is relatively uncommon; potentially a cause for celebration. However, almost half of boys and a third of girls with a BMI placing them in the overweight or obese BMI range perceived themselves to be about the right weight. Lack of awareness of excess weight among overweight and obese adolescents could be a cause for concern. International Journal of Obesity (2015) 39, 1488–1493; doi:10.1038/ijo.2015.126},

The data showed a decreased focus on their own ‘beautiful’ body parts in the high symptomatic participants, whereas inspection of their own ‘ugly’ body parts was given priority. In the normal control group a self-serving cognitive bias was found: they focused more on their own ‘beautiful’ body parts and less on their own ‘ugly’ body parts. When viewing other bodies the pattern was reversed: high symptom participants allocated their attention to the beautiful parts of other bodies, whereas normal controls concentrated on the ugly parts of the other bodies.

	abstract = {We show that populations of visually responsive cells in the anterior part of the superior temporal sulcus (STSa) of the macaque monkey code for the sight of both speciﬁc articulated body actions and the consequent articulated static body postures. We deﬁne articulated actions as actions where one body part (e.g. a limb or head) moves with respect to the remainder of the body which remains static; conversely non-articulated actions are actions where the equivalent body parts do not move with respect to each other but move as one. Similarly, articulated static body postures contain a torsion or rotation between parts, while non-articulated postures do not. Cells were tested with the sight of articulated and non-articulated actions followed by the resultant articulated or non-articulated static body postures. In addition, the static body postures that formed the start and end of the actions were tested in isolation. The cells studied did not respond to the sight of non-articulated static posture, which formed the starting-point of the action, but responded vigorously to the articulated static posture that formed the end-point of the action. Other static postures resembling the articulated end-point posture, but which were in a more relaxed muscular state (i.e. non-articulated), did not evoke responses. The cells did not respond to body actions that were less often associated with the effective static articulated postures. Our results suggest that the cells’ responses were related to the implied action rather than the static posture per se. We propose that the neural representations in STSa for actual biological motion may also extend to biological motion implied from static postures. These representations could play a role in producing the activity in the medial temporal/medial superior temporal (V5(MT)/MST) areas reported in fMRI studies when subjects view still photographs of people in action.},

	volume = {29},
	abstract = {Introduction: The clinical evidence shows that the onset of eating disorders is increasing in the prepubescent phase or even in childhood. Already starting from the prepubescence the certainties related to the body start to unwind and the individual is encouraged to build new ones, based both on the anatomic transformation of his/her own body and on the social expectation according to the identity. The onset of a Eating Disorders is normally between 13 and 25 years, but in the last years we recorded a lowering in the onset threshold to an age between 11 and 13 years, with some earlier cases at 7 years (Franzoni et al. 2012). Many theories consider body dissatisfaction as the immediate antecedent to the development of this eating disorder. Different studies have confirmed that a strong concern for physical appearance could sometimes precede an eating disorder (Cuzzolaro 2004). The alteration of the body image is the major predictive factor for the relapse, the patients themselves refer that it is one of the major obstacles for the realization of a lasting recovering. In the following study one hundred kids between 10 and 15 years old, without any Eating Disorders diagnosis, have been tested to evaluate whether if already from this age there is a concern about body image starting at this age, the fear of gaining weight and the desire to be slimmer. It is known, indeed, that these factors, if significantly present in a subject, can turn into predictive factors of a psychopathology. We need to build our body image over time; changing our percertion of reality can change also what we see, in particular the body image we strive for changes (Bianchini 2008).
Method: 100 teenagers split in 53 females and 47 males aged between 10 and 14 years, randomly picked in the secondary school.
Results: The results of the study show that in the age between 10 and 15 years the concern for the body shape is already present, without difference between the genders. Although 45\% of the sample is underweight, the Figure Raiting Scale test both males and females want to be of lesser weight. 91 subjects reached a BSQ test score of over 34, so most of the sample has a strong concern for their physical appearance. The results obtained by administering the BUT test also highlighted concern about the body with moderate gravity. Discussion: Body dissatisfaction, as so many studies have confirmed, can be considered a precursor of psychopathology. Concerns concern both female gender and male gender. It is also necessary to pay close attention to the pressure exerted by family members, friends and the media towards a difficult to reach thinness ideal. That is why we need to focus on strengthening protective factors in adolescents with prevention and awareness campaigns which are properly targeted.
Conclusion: The work resulted a useful reflection on the building of the body image as an early risk factor for the onset of pathologies linked to this concept. We need to commit to an educative practice of support for adolescent, recognition and sharing, which does not avoid the presence of the adults, but in fact it is enriched.},

Studies on somatosensory aspects thus far have been scarce. We therefore investigated whether AN patients and controls differed in tactile perception, and how this tactile body image related to visual body image and body dissatisfaction. The Tactile Estimation Task (TET) measured tactile body image: Two tactile stimuli were applied to forearm and abdomen, and, while blindfolded, participants estimated the distance between the two tactile stimuli between their thumb and index ﬁnger. The Distance Comparison Task (DCT) measured visual body image. Compared to controls (n = 25), AN patients (n = 20) not only visualized their body less accurately, but also overestimated distances between tactile stimuli on both the arm and abdomen, which might reﬂect a disturbance in both visual and tactile body image. High levels of body dissatisfaction were related to more severe inaccuracies in the visual mental image of the body, and overestimation of tactile distances. Our results imply that body image disturbances in AN are more widespread than previously assumed as they not only affect visual mental imagery, but also extend to disturbances in somatosensory aspects of body image.},

Previously it has been shown that these body representation disturbances extend to enlarged perception of tactile distances. Here we investigated whether misperception of tactile size could be related to inaccurate elementary somatosensory perception. Tactile size perception was measured with the Tactile Estimation Task (TET) (see Keizer et al., 2011). Elementary somatosensory perception was assessed with a pressure detection task and two point discrimination (TPD). Compared to controls (n ¼ 28), AN patients (n ¼25) overestimated tactile size, this effect was strongest for the abdomen. Elementary tactile perception deviated in AN as well: Patients had a lower threshold for detecting pressure on their abdomen, and a higher threshold for TPD on both the arm and abdomen. Regression results implied that group membership predicted tactile size estimation on the arm. Both group membership and TPD predicted tactile size estimation on the abdomen. Our results show that AN patients have a disturbance in the metric properties of the mental representation of their body as they overestimate the size of tactile stimuli compared to controls. Interestingly, AN patients and controls differ in elementary somatosensory perception as well. However, this could not solely explain misperception of tactile distances, suggesting that both bottom-up and top-down processes are involved.},

AN patients (n = 19) and healthy controls (HC; n = 20) were compared on bodyscaled action. Participants walked through door-like openings varying in width while performing a diversion task. AN patients and HC differed in the largest opening width for which they started rotating their shoulders to fit through. AN patients started rotating for openings 40\% wider than their own shoulders, while HC started rotating for apertures only 25\% wider than their shoulders. The results imply abnormalities in AN even at the level of the unconscious, action oriented body schema. Body representation disturbances in AN are thus more pervasive than previously assumed: They do not only affect (conscious) cognition and perception, but (unconscious) actions as well.},

The perception of our own body and more particularly our sense of body ownership is taken for granted. Nevertheless, experimental ﬁndings from body ownership illusions (BOIs), show that under speciﬁc multisensory conditions, we can experience artiﬁcial body parts or fake bodies as our own body parts or body, respectively. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how and why BOIs are induced. We review several experimental ﬁndings concerning the spatial, temporal, and semantic principles of crossmodal stimuli that have been applied to induce BOIs. On the basis of these principles, we discuss theoretical approaches concerning the underlying mechanism of BOIs. We propose a conceptualization based on Bayesian causal inference for addressing how our nervous system could infer whether an object belongs to our own body, using multisensory, sensorimotor, and semantic information, and we discuss how this can account for several experimental ﬁndings. Finally, we point to neural network models as an implementational framework within which the computational problem behind BOIs could be addressed in the future.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveaaMany studies have reported that Taekwondo training could improve body perception, control and brain activity, as assessed with an electroencephalogram. This study aimed to assess body intelligence and brain connectivity in children with Taekwondo training as compared to children without Taekwondo training.
MethodsaaFifteen children with Taekwondo training (TKD) and 13 age- and sex-matched children who had no previous experience of Taekwondo training (controls) were recruited. Body intelligence, clinical characteristics and brain connectivity in all children were assessed with the Body Intelligence Scale (BIS), self-report, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
ResultsaaThe mean BIS score in the TKD group was higher than that in the control group. The TKD group showed increased low-frequency fluctuations in the right frontal precentral gyrus and the right parietal precuneus, compared to the control group. The TKD group showed positive cerebellum vermis (lobe VII) seed to the right frontal, left frontal, and left parietal lobe. The control group showed positive cerebellum seed to the left frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex. Relative to the control group, the TKD group showed increased functional connectivity from cerebellum seed to the right inferior frontal gyrus.
ConclusionaaTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effect of Taekwondo training on brain connectivity in children. Taekwondo training improved body intelligence and brain connectivity from the cerebellum to the parietal and frontal cortex. Psychiatry Investig 2015;12(3):335-340},

These measures were: the Body Appreciation Scale (original BAS and BAS-2), the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults, the Body Shape Questionnaire, the Centre for Appearance Research Valence Scale, the Drive for Muscularity Scale, two subscales of the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire, one subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory 3, and two subscales of the Multidimensional Body Relations Questionnaire. Articles assessing these scales’ psychometric properties (N = 136) were evaluated for their methodological quality using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist, and a best evidence synthesis was performed. The results supported the majority of measures in terms of reliability and validity; however, suitability varied across populations, and some measurement properties were insufﬁciently evaluated. The measures are discussed in detail, including recommendations for their future use in research and clinical practice.},

But representative and prospective data in children are lacking and therefore, the exact nature of these observed associations remains unclear. Data on IS measured by heartbeat perception ability in 1657 children between 6 and 11 years of age were collected on the basis of two measurement points with a year distance in time. Stability of the construct and its prospective association with different food approach behaviors [assessed via parent questionnaires (Children’s Eating Behavior Questionnaire and Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire)] as well as with weight status were analyzed via structural equation modeling. Main results were that only in overweight children external and emotional eating behavior were predictive for later IS, whereas no such relation was found in normal weight children. There was no direct relation between IS and body mass index. For the ﬁrst time, we could show that eating behavior and IS in middle childhood are prospectively related to each other. But surprisingly, our data indicate that altered interoceptive processes rather follow than precede non-adaptive eating behavior patterns in overweight children. This suggests a possible crucial role of faulty learning mechanisms in eating behavior early in life, undermining the later conﬁdence in one’s body.},

However, therapies addressing the body are typically marginalized within treatment programs for anorexia nervosa. The purpose of this article is to 1) describe common bodily symptoms and experiences of anorexia nervosa patients and discuss the accompanying physical and emotional impact, and 2) present physiotherapeutic approaches to help patients with anorexia nervosa. Recommendations are based on the author’s clinical observations and patient testimonials, in addition to the theory and methodology outlined by Norwegian Psychomotor Physiotherapy (NPMP), body awareness therapies, and current knowledge on bodily stability. It is the author’s experience that anorexia nervosa patients tend to have signiﬁcant impairments in their body awareness, a restricted breathing pattern, significant muscular tension, poor postural stability, and they are frequently engaged in compulsive physical activity. A body awareness approach for these patients may contribute to novel ways of sensing and interpreting bodily signals, improving emotional awareness, experiencing the body and integrating the body as one’s own, i.e., becoming an embodied person. Embodying the body in patients with anorexia nervosa by utilizing approaches from NPMP and body awareness therapies, in addition to stability training principles, may help stabilize the body and the mind, and thus, constitute a beneﬁcial addition to overall treatment for anorexia nervosa.},

However, little is known about the neural basis of this construct, especially how it is maintained during resting state. To explore the neural correlates of social well-being, this study correlated the regional fractional amplitude of low frequency ﬂuctuations (fALFF) with social well-being of healthy individuals. The results revealed that the fALFF in the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right thalamus and right insula positively predicted individual differences in social well-being. Furthermore, we demonstrated the different role of three pursuits of human well-being (i.e., pleasure, meaning and engagement) in these associations. Speciﬁcally, the pursuits of meaning and engagement, not pleasure mediated the effect of the fALFF in right pSTG on social well-being, whereas the pursuit of engagement mediated the effect of the fALFF in right thalamus on social wellbeing. Taken together, we provide the ﬁrst evidence that spontaneous brain activity in multiple regions related to self-regulatory and social-cognitive processes contributes to social well-being, suggesting that the spontaneous activity of the human brain reﬂects the efﬁciency of social well-being.},

Previous studies have shown that personality traits, especially extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, significantly contribute to EWB. However, the neurobiological pathways linking personality and EWB are not understood. Here, we used restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate this issue. Specifically, we correlated individuals’ EWB scores with the regional fractional amplitude of lowfrequency fluctuations (fALFF) of the brain, and then examined how personality traits predicted EWB-related spontaneous brain activity. We found that EWB was positively correlated with the fALFF in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and thalamus, and negatively correlated with the strength of the thalamic-insular connectivity. More importantly, we found that personality traits influenced EWB in different ways. At the regional level, the fALFF in the pSTG and thalamus mediated the effects of neuroticism and extraversion on EWB, whereas the thalamus mediated the effect of conscientiousness on EWB. At the functional connectivity level, the thalamic-insular connectivity only mediated the effect of neuroticism on EWB. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence that EWB is associated with personality traits through different neural substrates.},

Although some moderators and driving mechanisms have been identified, a comprehensive conceptual account of how bodily states or dynamics influence behavior is still missing. Here, we attempt to integrate current knowledge by describing three basic psychological mechanisms: direct state induction, which influences how humans feel or process information, unmediated by any other cognitive mechanism; modal priming, which changes the accessibility of concepts associated with a bodily state; sensorimotor simulation, which affects the ease with which congruent and incongruent actions are performed. We argue that the joint impact of these mechanisms can account for most existing embodiment effects. Additionally, we summarize empirical tests for distinguishing these mechanisms and suggest a guideline for future research about the mechanisms underlying embodiment effects.},

Methods: We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging on 11 healthy young men and 11 healthy young women using the “body image tasks” which consisted of fat, real, and thin shapes of the subject’s own body.
Results: Comparison of the brain activation upon performing the fat-image task versus real-image task showed significant activation of the bilateral prefrontal cortex and left parahippocampal area including the amygdala in the women, and significant activation of the right occipital lobe including the primary and secondary visual cortices in the men. Comparison of brain activation upon performing the thin-image task versus real-image task showed significant activation of the left prefrontal cortex, left limbic area including the cingulate gyrus and paralimbic area including the insula in women, and significant activation of the occipital lobe including the left primary and secondary visual cortices in men.
Conclusions: These results suggest that women tend to perceive distorted images of their own bodies by complex cognitive processing of emotion, whereas men tend to perceive distorted images of their own bodies by object visual processing and spatial visual processing.},

However, task-rest interactions in emotive paradigms have received considerably less attention. In this study, we therefore investigated task-rest interactions evoked by the induction and instructed regulation of negative emotion. Whole-brain, functional MRI data were acquired from 55 healthy participants. Two-level general linear model statistics were computed to test for differences between conditions, separately for stimulation and for fixation periods, as well as for interactions between stimulation and fixation (task-rest interactions). Results showed that the regulation of negative emotion led to reverse task-rest interactions (decreased activation during stimulation but increased activation during fixation) in the amygdala as well as in visual cortex regions and to concordant task-rest interactions (increased activation during both, stimulation and fixation) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as in a number of brain regions at the intersection of the default mode and the dorsal attention networks. Thus, this first whole-brain investigation of task-rest interactions following the induction and regulation of negative emotion identified a widespread specific modulation of brain activation in regions subserving emotion generation and regulation as well as regions implicated in attention and default mode.},

Only few studies have examined the character of body-image disturbance in children/adolescents with eating disorders. It is unknown whether body-image disturbances in children/adolescent with eating disturbances are comparable to those of adult patients with eating disorders. Body-image disturbance might differ quantitatively and qualitatively according to the cognitive developmental status and the age of the individual. This paper provides an overview of the current evidence for body-image disturbance in children/adolescents with eating disorders, and how they compare with those adults with eating disorders. Current evidence indicates that older adolescent patients show similar deficits as adult patients with eating disorders, in particular for the attitudinal body-image component. However, evidence for a perceptual body-image disturbance in adolescent patients, in particular anorexia nervosa, is not conclusive. Reliable statements for childhood can hardly be made because clinical studies are not available. Investigations of body-image disturbance in children have focused on the predictive value for eating disorders. Limitations of the current evidence are discussed, and future directions for research and therapy are indicated.},

	abstract = {The present investigation concerns the multidimensionality of self-consciousness. I will speciﬁcally address this general issue by focusing on bodily self-consciousness and by considering how one is conscious of one’s body through consciousness of both its physicality and its subjectivity. Here, physicality is deﬁned as the belongingness to the physical world; subjectivity is deﬁned as the fact of being a subject of conscious experience. Once subjectivity and physicality are differentiated from each other, the difﬁculty is to clarify the integration of these dimensions of bodily self-consciousness into a single experience of one’s body: how does the consciousness of one’s body integrate one’s consciousness of one’s body-assubjective and one’s consciousness of one’s body-as-physical? In this investigation, I describe different forms of bodily self-consciousness in ways that shed light on the intermingling of subjectivity and physicality. I argue that being conscious of one’s body-as-subjective involves experiencing one’s belongingness to the physical world; conversely, being conscious of one’s body-as-physical involves experiencing it as one’s own; either way, such forms of bodily self-consciousness involve experiencing both the subjectivity and the physicality of one’s body. The hypothesis here is that the imbalance of these dimensions relative to each other would be pathological.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal effects of body size over- and underestimation and other psychosocial factors on the risk for onset of overweight (OW) or obesity (OB) 1 year later among US adolescents. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants with non-missing height and weight were drawn from the ﬁrst two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 13 568). Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to assess longitudinal risk factors for OW and OB onset, controlling for baseline weight status, age, race/ethnicity, parent education and family structure. Analyses were stratiﬁed by sex.
RESULTS: Compared with accurate body size perception, body size overestimation increased the relative risk (RR) of OW onset among women and men (RR = 3.34, conﬁdence interval (CI) = 2.39–4.68; RR = 6.01, CI = 4.09–8.83, respectively, P o0.001) in fully adjusted models including body mass index z-scores. Body size underestimation decreased the RR of OW onset among women and men (RR = 0.08, CI = 0.03–0.20; RR = 0.13, CI = 0.06–0.27, respectively) and OB onset (RR = 0.05, CI = 0.02–0.14; RR = 0.19, CI = 0.08–0.47, respectively, P o 0.001 for all) in fully adjusted models. Dieting, extreme weight loss behaviors and skipping breakfast at Wave 1 increased the risk of OB onset by Wave 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to a common assumption, body size underestimation did not increase, but in fact decreased, the RR for the onset of OW and of OB among adolescents using a prospective longitudinal design. However, body size overestimation predicted onset of OW 1 year later. Body size self-concept and other psychosocial factors have an important role in risk for OW and for OB among both males and females during adolescence.

In a series of studies, we show that there are dramatic systematic distortions in the perception of bodily proportions, as assessed by visual estimation tasks, where participants were asked to compare the lengths of two body parts. These distortions are not evident when participants estimate the extent of a body part relative to a noncorporeal object or when asked to estimate noncorporal objects that are the same length as their body parts. Our results reveal a radical asymmetry in the perception of corporeal and noncorporeal relative size estimates. Our findings also suggest that people visually perceive the relative size of their body parts as a function of each part’s relative tactile sensitivity and physical size.},

	abstract = {The perceived distance between touches on a single skin surface is larger on regions of high tactile sensitivity than those with lower acuity, an effect known as Weber’s illusion. This illusion suggests that tactile size perception involves a representation of the perceived size of body parts preserving characteristics of the somatosensory homunculus. Here, we investigated how body shape is coded within this representation by comparing tactile distances presented in different orientations on the hand. Participants judged which of two tactile distances on the dorsum of their left hand felt larger. One distance was aligned with the proximodistal axis (along the hand), the other with the mediolateral axis (across the hand). Across distances were consistently perceived as larger than along ones. A second experiment showed that this effect is specific to the hairy skin of the hand dorsum and does not occur on glabrous skin of the palm. A third experiment demonstrated that this bias reflects orientation on the hand surface, rather than an eye- or torso-centered reference frame. These results mirror known orientational anisotropies of both tactile acuity and of tactile receptive fields (RFs) of cortical neurons. We suggest that the dorsum of the hand is implicitly represented as wider than it actually is and that the shape of tactile RFs may partly explain distortions of mental body representations.},

While several studies have reported effects of viewing the body on cortical processing of touch and pain, the neural locus of this modulation remains unclear. We investigated whether seeing the body modulates processing in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) by measuring short-latency somatosensory evoked-potentials (SEPs) elicited by electrical stimulation of the median nerve while participants looked directly at their stimulated hand or at a non-hand object. Vision of the body produced a clear reduction of the P27 component of the SEP recorded over contralateral parietal channels, which is known to reﬂect processing in SI. These results provide the ﬁrst direct evidence that seeing the body modulates processing in SI and demonstrate that vision can affect even the earliest stages of cortical somatosensory processing.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that somatosensory processing relies on a class of implicit body representations showing large distortions of size and shape. The relation between these representations and the conscious body image remains unclear. Dissociations have been reported in the clinical literature on eating disorders between different body image measures, with larger and more consistent distortions found with depictive measures, in which participants compare their body to a visual depiction of a body, than metric measures, in which participants compare their body to some non-body standard. Here, we compared implicit body representations underlying position sense to the body image measured with both depictive and metric methods. The body image was measured using both a depictive method (template matching) in which participants judged whether their hand was wider or more slender than a shown hand picture, and a metric method (line length) in which participants judged whether different parts of their hand were shorter or longer than a presented line. Consistent with previous ﬁndings, characteristic distortions were found for the implicit body representation underlying position sense. These distortions were also found in attenuated form for metric – but not depictive – body image measures. While replicating the basic dissociation between implicit body representations and the conscious body image, these results demonstrate that this dissociation is not absolute and speciﬁc tasks may utilise both to varying degrees depending on task demands. Metric measures may not be pure measures of body image, but some combination of visual and somatosensory body representations.},

While previous results demonstrate that vision of the body modulates somatosensory sensitivity, it is unknown whether vision also affects metric properties of touch, and if so how. This study investigated how non-informative vision of the body modulates tactile size perception. We used the mirror box illusion to induce the illusion that participants were directly seeing their stimulated left hand, though they actually saw their reflected right hand. We manipulated whether participants: (a) had the illusion of directly seeing their stimulated left hand, (b) had the illusion of seeing a non-body object at the same location, or (c) looked directly at their nonstimulated right-hand. Participants made verbal estimates of the perceived distance between two tactile stimuli presented simultaneously to the dorsum of the left hand, either 20, 30, or 40 mm apart. Vision of the body significantly reduced the perceived size of touch, compared to vision of the object or of the contralateral hand. In contrast, no apparent changes of perceived hand size were found. These results show that seeing the body distorts tactile size perception.},

This requirement is especially acute in somatosensation in which the main receptor surface (i.e., the skin) is itself coextensive with the body. This paper reviews recent research investigating the body representations underlying somatosensory information processing, including abilities such as tactile localization, tactile size perception, and position sense. These representations show remarkably large and stereotyped distortions of represented body size and shape. Intriguingly, these distortions appear to mirror distortions characteristic of somatosensory maps, though in attenuated form. In contrast, when asked to make overt judgments about perceived body form, participants are generally quite accurate. This pattern of results suggests that higher-level somatosensory processing relies on a class of implicit body representation, distinct from the conscious body image.

In contrast, the body is represented in somatosensory cortex as a fragmented collection of twodimensional (2-D) maps. Recent results have suggested that some forms of higher-level body representations maintain this fragmentation, for example by showing different patterns of distortion for two surfaces of a single body part, such as the palmar and dorsal hand surfaces. This study investigated the 3-D coherence of the conscious body image of the hand by comparing perceptual biases of perceived hand shape on the dorsal and palmar surfaces. Participants made forced-choice judgments of whether observed hand images were thinner or wider than their own left or right hand, and perceptual distortions of the hand image were assessed by fitting psychometric functions. The results suggested that the hand is consciously represented as a fully coherent, 3-D object. Specifically: (1) similar overall levels of distortion were found on the palmar and dorsal hand surfaces, (2) comparable laterality effects were found on both surfaces (left hand represented as wider than right hand), and (3) the magnitude of distortions were strongly correlated across the two surfaces. Whereas other recent results have suggested that perceptual abilities such as position sense, tactile size perception, and tactile localisation may rely on fragmented, 2-D representations of individual skin surfaces, the present results suggest that, in striking contrast, the conscious body image represents the body (or, at least the hand) as a coherent, 3-D object.},

	abstract = {Delusions and misperceptions about the body are a conspicuous feature of numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions. In stark contrast to such pathological cases, the immediacy and familiarity of our ordinary experience of our body can make it seem as if our representation of our body is highly accurate, even infallible. Recent research has begun to demonstrate, however, that large and systematic distortions of body representation are a normal part of healthy cognition. Here, I will describe this research, focusing on distortions of body representations underlying tactile distance perception and position sense. I will also discuss evidence for distortions of higherorder body representations, such as the conscious body image. Finally, I will end with a discussion of the potential relations among different body representations and their distortions.},

	abstract = {The neural circuits underlying initial sensory processing of somatic information are relatively well understood. In contrast, the processes that go beyond primary somatosensation to create more abstract representations related to the body are less clear. In this review, we focus on two classes of higher-order processing beyond somatosensation. Somatoperception refers to the process of perceiving the body itself, and particularly of ensuring somatic perceptual constancy. We review three key elements of somatoperception: (a) remapping information from the body surface into an egocentric reference frame, (b) exteroceptive perception of objects in the external world through their contact with the body, and (c) interoceptive percepts about the nature and state of the body itself. Somatorepresentation, in contrast, refers to the essentially cognitive process of constructing semantic knowledge and attitudes about the body, including: (d) lexical-semantic knowledge about bodies generally and one’s own body speciﬁcally, (e) conﬁgural knowledge about the structure of bodies, (f) emotions and attitudes directed towards one’s own body, and (g) the link between physical body and psychological self. We review a wide range of neuropsychological, neuroimaging and neurophysiological data to explore the dissociation between these different aspects of higher somatosensory function.},

	abstract = {Objective: Obesity prevention in childhood is important. However, changing children’s lifestyle behaviors to reduce overweight is a substantial challenge. Accurately perceiving oneself as overweight/obese has been linked to greater motivation to change lifestyle behaviors. Children and adolescents may be less likely to perceive themselves as overweight/obese if they are exposed to overweight/obese people in their immediate environments. This study examined whether youth who are exposed to overweight parents and schoolmates were more likely to misperceive their own weight status. Design: The Quebec Child and Adolescent Health and Social Survey was a provincially representative, school-based survey of children and adolescents conducted between January and May 1999. Subjects: 3665 children and adolescents (age 9, n ¼ 1267; age 13, n ¼ 1186; age 16, n ¼ 1212) from 178 schools. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 17.5, 20.6 and 22.2 kg/m2, respectively.
Measurements: The misperception score was calculated as the standardized difference between self-perception of weight status (Stunkard Body Rating Scale) and actual BMI (from measured height and weight). Exposure to obesity was based on parent and schoolmate BMI.
Results: Overweight and obese youth were significantly more likely to misperceive their weight compared with non-overweight youth (Po0.001). Multilevel modeling indicated that greater parent and schoolmate BMI were significantly associated with greater misperception (underestimation) of weight status among children and adolescents.
Conclusion: Children and adolescents who live in environments in which people they see on a daily basis, such as parents and schoolmates, are overweight/obese may develop inaccurate perceptions of what constitutes appropriate weight status. Targeting misperception may facilitate the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors and improve the effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions.},

	abstract = {The self-serving bias is the tendency to consider oneself in unrealistically positive terms. This phenomenon has been documented for body attractiveness, but it remains unclear to what extent it can also emerge for own body size perception. In the present study, we examined this issue in healthy young adults (45 females and 40 males), using two body size estimation (BSE) measures and taking into account inter-individual differences in eating disorder risk. Participants observed pictures of avatars, built from whole body photos of themselves or an unknown other matched for gender. Avatars were parametrically distorted along the thinness–heaviness dimension, and individualised by adding the head of the self or the other. In the first BSE task, participants indicated in each trial whether the seen avatar was thinner or fatter than themselves (or the other). In the second BSE task, participants chose the best representative body size for self and other from a set of avatars. Greater underestimation for self than other body size emerged in both tasks, comparably for women and men. Thinner bodies were also judged as more attractive, in line with standard of beauty in modern western society. Notably, this self-serving bias in BSE was stronger in people with low eating disorder risk. In sum, positive attitudes towards the self can extend to body size estimation in young adults, making own body size closer to the ideal body. We propose that this bias could play an adaptive role in preserving a positive body image.},

A neutral object (a vase) was also adjusted to partial out the level of perceptual distortion present with a neutral object. Men and women overestimated the size of the neutral object and their body image. Among women, overestimation was primarily predicted by high levels of depression, and media and peer inﬂuences to be thinner and increase muscles. Among men, overestimation was predicted by high BMI, media inﬂuences to lose weight and increase muscles, and peer inﬂuences to increase muscles. These ﬁndings suggest that perceptual accuracy of body image is primarily predicted by biopsychosocial inﬂuences.},

The underlying neuropsychological mechanisms of face processing have been studied extensively and recent interest has also focused on the study of body shape perception. The present article aims to summarize and to critically evaluate the evidence for and against the speciﬁcity of body shape processing. Cognitive mechanisms, neurocognitive models and neuronal correlates of body processing will be compared with corresponding evidence related to human face processing. Clinical phenomena related to body shape perception will also be addressed. The available data base documents a range of similarities and differences between face and body perception with respect to the cognitive mechanisms, neuronal correlates and neuropsychological impairment patterns. The lack of a selective deﬁcit in body perception is the most important difference between both categories. The sparse data base for human body shape perception does not yet allow any ﬁrm conclusions with respect to its underlying neuropsychological mechanisms.},

Methods: Exploratory cross‑sectional study conducted with 120 female adolescents aged between 14‑19 years, from the city of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Southeast Brazil. Body image was evaluated with a Body Silhouette Scale (BSS) and a Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Weight, height, and waist circumference values were analyzed, as well as the waist‑to‑height ratio and body fat percentage. The physical activity level (PAL) was assessed by 24‑hour Physical Activity Recall and SB by screen time, that is, time spent in front of a TV, playing video game, on the computer and using tablets, and, separately, the cell phone time.
Results: Mean age was 16.5±1.5 years, and most adolescents were eutrophic (77.6\%), sedentary/low PAL (84.2\%), with high screen time (85.2\%) and cell phone time (58.7\%). Body dissatisfaction was stated in 40.6\% of BSQ and 45.8\% of BSS evaluations. Body distortion was identified in 52.9\% of participants. All body composition measures, along with cell phone time and PAL, were associated with body dissatisfaction, the more active adolescents presenting higher levels of dissatisfaction.
Conclusions: This study concluded that female adolescents with higher cell phone time also present higher body dissatisfaction, as well as the most physically active ones. All body composition measurements were associated with body dissatisfaction, mainly body mass index, waist circumference, and waist‑to‑height ratio.},

	abstract = {Hallucinations and other unusual sensory experiences (USE) can occur in all modalities in the general population. Yet, the existing literature is dominated by investigations into auditory hallucinations (“voices”), while other modalities remain under-researched. Furthermore, there is a paucity of measures which can systematically assess different modalities, which limits our ability to detect individual and group differences across modalities. The current study explored such differences using a new scale, the Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ). The MUSEQ is a 43-item self-report measure which assesses USE in six modalities: auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, bodily sensations, and sensed presence. Scale development and validation involved a total of 1,300 participants, which included: 513 students and community members for initial development, 32 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder for validation, 659 students for factor replication, and 96 students for test-retest reliability. Conﬁrmatory factor analyses showed that a correlated-factors model and bifactor model yielded acceptable model ﬁt, while a unidimensional model ﬁtted poorly. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed in the replication sample. Results showed contributions from a general common factor, as well as modality-speciﬁc factors. The latter accounted for less variance than the general factor, but could still detect theoretically meaningful group differences. The MUSEQ showed good reliability, construct validity, and could discriminate non-clinical and clinical groups. The MUSEQ offers a reliable means of measuring hallucinations and other USE in six different modalities.},

The authors investigated brain activation patterns during the perception of distorted body images in various subtypes of ED. Participants comprised 33 patients with EDs (11 with restricting-type anorexia nervosa (AN-R), 11 with binging–purging type anorexia nervosa (AN-BP), 11 with bulimia nervosa (BN)) and 11 healthy women. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine cerebral response to morphed images of subjects' own bodies, as well as that of another woman. The amygdala was signiﬁcantly activated in AN-R patients, AN-BP patients, and healthy women in response to their own fat-image, but this did not occur in BN patients. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) was signiﬁcantly activated in AN-BP patients and healthy women, but not in AN-R and BN patients. Our results showed that the various EDs are different with respect to signiﬁcant activation of the amygdala and PFC during the processing of participants' own fat-image. Brain activation pattern differences between the various EDs may underlie cognitive differences with respect to distorted body image, and therefore might reﬂect a general failure to represent and evaluate one's own body in a realistic fashion.},

	abstract = {Eating disorders (EDs) are associated with abnormalities of body image perception. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional abnormalities in brain systems during processing of negative words concerning body images in patients with EDs. Brain responses to negative words concerning body images (task condition) and neutral words (control condition) were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 patients with EDs (12 with the restricting type anorexia nervosa; AN-R, 12 with the binging–purging type anorexia nervosa; AN-BP, and 12 with bulimia nervosa; BN) and 12 healthy young women. Participants were instructed to select the most negative word from each negative body-image word set and to select the most neutral word from each neutral word set. In the task relative to the control condition, the right amygdala was activated both in patients with AN-R and in patients with AN-BP. The left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was activated both in patients with BN and in patients with AN-BP. It is suggested that these brain activations may be associated with abnormalities of body image perception. Amygdala activation may be involved in fearful emotional processing of negative words concerning body image and strong fears of gaining weight. One possible interpretation of the ﬁnding of mPFC activation is that it may reﬂect an attempt to regulate the emotion invoked by the stimuli. These abnormal brain functions may help provide better accounts of the psychopathological mechanisms underlying EDs.},

Using classical psychophysics, 60 right-handed healthy participants (30 women) were brieﬂy presented with size-distorted pictures of themselves, another person (an experimenter), and a non-corporal, familiar object (a coke bottle) to the central, right, and left visual ﬁeld. Participants had to decide whether the presented stimulus was fatter or thinner than the real body/object, and thus compare the presented picture with the stored representation of the stimulus from memory. From these data we extracted the amount of image distortion at which participants judged the various stimuli to be veridical. We found that right visual ﬁeld presentations (initial left hemisphere processing) revealed a general “fatter” bias, which was more evident for bodies than for objects. Crucially, a “fatter” bias with own body presentations in the left visual ﬁeld (initial right hemisphere processing) was only found for women. Our ﬁndings suggest that right visual ﬁeld presentation results in a general size overestimation, and that this overestimation is more pronounced for bodies than for objects. Moreover, the particular “fatter” bias after own body presentations to the left visual ﬁeld in women supports the notion of a speciﬁc role of the right hemisphere in sex-speciﬁc body image distortion.},

	abstract = {Background. Body image distortion is a key symptom of anorexia nervosa. In behavioral research two components of body image have been deﬁned : attitudes towards the body and body size experience. Neuroimaging studies concerning own body image distortions in anorexia nervosa have revealed an inconsistent pattern of results and are constrained by the fact that no direct distinction between the diﬀerent parts of body image has been made.
Method. The present study therefore set out to investigate the neural correlates of two parts of the own body image using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) : satisfaction rating and size estimation for distorted own body photographs in patients with anorexia nervosa and controls.
Results. Anorectic patients were less satisﬁed with their current body shape than controls. Patients further demonstrated stronger activation of the insula and lateral prefrontal cortex during the satisfaction rating of thin selfimages. This indicates a stronger emotional involvement when patients are presented with distorted images close to their own ideal body size. Patients also overestimated their own body size. We were able to show complex diﬀerential modulations in activation of the precuneus during body size estimation in control and anorectic subjects. It could be speculated that a deﬁcit in the retrieval of a multimodal coded body schema in precuneus/posterior parietal cortex is related to body size overestimation.
Conclusions. We were able to ﬁnd speciﬁc behavioral responses and neural activation patterns for two parts of body image in anorexia nervosa and healthy controls. Thus, the present results underline the importance of developing research and therapeutic strategies that target the two diﬀerent aspects of body image separately.},

In behavioral research two components of body image have been deﬁned: attitudes towards the body and body size estimation. Only few fMRI-studies investigated the neural correlates of body image in bulimia; those are constrained by the lack of a direct distinction between these different body image components.
Methods: The present study investigates the neural correlates of two aspects of the body image using fMRI: satisfaction rating and size estimation of distorted own body photographs in bulimia nervosa patients (15) and controls (16).
Results: Patients were less satisﬁed with their current body shape than controls and preferred to be thinner. The amount of insula activity reﬂects the pattern of the satisfaction rating for patients and controls. Patients also overestimated their own body size. For control subjects, an activated cluster in lateral occipital cortex was sensitive for body size distortions, whereas bulimic patients did not demonstrate such a modulation. Furthermore, bulimic subjects did not recruit the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in contrast to controls during the body size estimation task, maybe indicating a reduced spatial manipulation capacity. Therefore, this activation pattern of lateral occipital cortex and MFG might be responsible for body size overestimation in bulimia.
Conclusions: The present results show that bulimic patients exhibit two distinct deﬁcits in body image representations similar to anorectic patients and that speciﬁcally associated neuronal correlates can be identiﬁed. Concludingly, our study support psychotherapeutic strategies speciﬁcally targeting these two aspects of body image distortions.},

Methods Sixty obese (OBE) and 27 normal-weight (NW) children and adolescents (age: 9–17) were assessed for body representation using a multi-method approach. Therefore, we assessed body size estimation, tactile size estimation, heartbeat detection accuracy, and attitudes towards one’s own body. OBE were examined upon admission and before discharge of an inpatient weight-reduction program. NW served as cross-sectional control group.
Results Body size estimation and heartbeat detection accuracy were similar in OBE and NW. OBE overestimated sizes in tactile size estimation and were more dissatisfied with their body as compared to NW. In OBE but not in NW, several measures of body size estimation correlated with negative body evaluation. After weight-loss treatment, OBE had improved in heartbeat detection accuracy and were less dissatisfied with their body. None of the assessed variables predicted weight-loss success.

Despite recent technical advances in research, it is still unknown whether this body image disturbance is characterized by body dissatisfaction and a low ideal weight and/or includes a distorted perception or processing of body size. In this article, we provide an update and meta-analysis of 42 articles summarizing measures and results for body size estimation (BSE) from 926 individuals with AN, 536 individuals with BN and 1920 controls. We replicate ﬁndings that individuals with AN and BN overestimate their body size as compared to controls (ES = 0.63). Our meta-regression shows that metric methods (BSE by direct or indirect spatial measures) yield larger eﬀect sizes than depictive methods (BSE by evaluating distorted pictures), and that eﬀect sizes are larger for patients with BN than for patients with AN. To interpret these results, we suggest a revised theoretical framework for BSE that accounts for diﬀerences between depictive and metric BSE methods regarding the underlying body representations (conceptual vs. perceptual, implicit vs. explicit). We also discuss clinical implications and argue for the importance of multimethod approaches to investigate body image disturbance.},

The aims of the study were (i) to compare FRS body weight dissatisfaction and perceptual distortion of women with anorexia nervosa (AN) to a community sample; (ii) how FRS parameters are associated with questionnaire body dissatisfaction, eating disorder symptoms and appearance comparison habits; and (iii) whether the weight spectrum of the FRS matters. Women with AN (n = 24) and a community sample of women (n = 104) selected their current and ideal body on the FRS and completed additional questionnaires. Women with AN accurately picked the body that aligned best with their actual weight in both FRS. Controls underestimated their BMI in the FRS 14–32 and were accurate in the FRS 18–42. In both FRS, women with AN desired a body close to their actual BMI and controls desired a thinner body. Our observations suggest that body image disturbance in AN is unlikely to be characterized by a visual perceptual disturbance, but rather by an idealization of underweight in conjunction with high body dissatisfaction. The weight spectrum of FRS can inﬂuence the accuracy of BMI estimation. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.},

	abstract = {Background. Body image disturbance (BID) is a core symptom of anorexia nervosa (AN), but as yet distinctive features of BID are unknown. The present study aimed at disentangling perceptual and attitudinal components of BID in AN.
Methods. We investigated n = 24 women with AN and n = 24 controls. Based on a three-dimensional (3D) body scan, we created realistic virtual 3D bodies (avatars) for each participant that were varied through a range of ±20\% of the participants’ weights. Avatars were presented in a virtual reality mirror scenario. Using different psychophysical tasks, participants identiﬁed and adjusted their actual and their desired body weight. To test for general perceptual biases in estimating body weight, a second experiment investigated perception of weight and shape matched avatars with another identity.
Results. Women with AN and controls underestimated their weight, with a trend that women with AN underestimated more. The average desired body of controls had normal weight while the average desired weight of women with AN corresponded to extreme AN (DSM-5). Correlation analyses revealed that desired body weight, but not accuracy of weight estimation, was associated with eating disorder symptoms. In the second experiment, both groups estimated accurately while the most attractive body was similar to Experiment 1.
Conclusions. Our results contradict the widespread assumption that patients with AN overestimate their body weight due to visual distortions. Rather, they illustrate that BID might be driven by distorted attitudes with regard to the desired body. Clinical interventions should aim at helping patients with AN to change their desired weight.},

	abstract = {The body-schema concept is revisited in the context of embodied cognition, further developing the theory formulated by Marc Jeannerod that the motor system is part of a simulation network related to action, whose function is not only to shape the motor system for preparing an action (either overt or covert) but also to provide the self with information on the feasibility and the meaning of potential actions. The proposed computational formulation is based on a dynamical system approach, which is linked to an extension of the equilibrium-point hypothesis, called Passive Motor Paradigm: this dynamical system generates goal-oriented, spatio-temporal, sensorimotor patterns, integrating a direct and inverse internal model in a multi-referential framework. The purpose of such computational model is to operate at the same time as a general synergy formation machinery for planning whole-body actions in humanoid robots and/or for predicting coordinated sensory–motor patterns in human movements. In order to illustrate the computational approach, the integration of simultaneous, even partially conﬂicting tasks will be analyzed in some detail with regard to postural-focal dynamics, which can be deﬁned as the fusion of a focal task, namely reaching a target with the whole-body, and a postural task, namely maintaining overall stability.},

The article focuses on discussing different concepts of self as based on the philosophical accounts. These are then complemented by neuroscientific data on self and self-reference. Finally both philosophical and neuroscientific accounts are directly compared with each other while at the same time their relevance for psychoanalysis of self and ego are pointed out.},

Seventy-one women (AN: 37, controls: 35), aged 14–29 years, were assessed with a computerized body size estimation morphing program. Information was gathered on depression, anxiety, time since last meal, weight and height. Results showed that patients overestimated their body size signiﬁcantly more than controls, both in the memory and perception condition. Further, patients overestimated their body size signiﬁcantly more when estimation was based on perception than memory. When controlling for anxiety, the difference between patients and controls no longer reached signiﬁcance. None of the other confounders contributed signiﬁcantly to the model. The results suggest that anxiety plays a role in overestimation of body size in AN. This ﬁnding might inform treatment, suggesting that more focus should be aimed at the underlying anxiety.

Additional behavioral evidence suggests signiﬁcant sex differences in sensitivity both to social norms and to information about one’s own body, particularly as it pertains to assessments of self-worth. Because these observed sex differences are hypothesized to arise from differences in cognitive representations of the self, brain activation differences in mPFC might likewise be expected while men and women process information about body image. In this study, 10 females and nine males viewed images of gender-matched bodies of either an overweight body type or a thin body type while undergoing functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. While viewing these images, participants were instructed to make evaluations of their own bodies in relation to the images displayed. Signiﬁcant within-group contrasts in mPFC activation were observed for women only, with relatively higher activation for overweight images versus thin images. Men showed no signiﬁcant mPFC activation while processing either type of image. These results are consistent with cognitive models of self-representation, particularly those developed within social and cultural theoretical frameworks, where body size is hypothesized to play a dominant role in schematic representations of self-worth for many women.},

In the present investigation, thermal pain threshold latency, somatoform dissociation, body image disturbance and physiological indices of autonomic neural system activity were measured in 39 female patients with eating disorders (21 with anorexia nervosa and 18 with bulimia nervosa) and 17 healthy women. Pain threshold was elevated in patients with eating disorders, especially those with binge–purging symptomatology. A regression analysis indicated that increased pain threshold is moderately associated with decreased peripheral skin temperature and weakly associated with lack of familiarity with oneÕs own body. However, the between group diﬀerences in pain perception remained signiﬁcant after controlling for peripheral skin temperature. Hence, elevation of pain threshold in eating disorders is a replicable ﬁnding, which is not explicable by peripheral indices of autonomic system activity or by somatoform dissociation. In future research it may be evaluated as a potential marker of broader phenotype of decreased interoceptive awareness, which may be associated with vulnerability to the development of eating disorders.},

It is unclear, however, whether the social brain is sex speciﬁc. Here we assess sex impact on the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) cortical response to point-light human locomotion. Sex differences in the cortical MEG response to biological motion occur mostly over the right brain hemisphere. At early latencies, females exhibit a greater activation than males over the right parietal, left temporal, and right temporal cortex, a core of the social brain. At later latencies, the boosts of activation are greater in males over the right frontal and occipital cortices. The ﬁndings deliver the ﬁrst evidence for gender-dependent modes in the time course and topography of the neural circuitry underpinning visual processing of biological motion. The outcome represents a framework for studying sex differences in the social brain in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Despite multiple sources, the immediate prediction, construction, and evaluation of one’s body are distorted. The origins of such distortions are unclear. In this review, we consider three possible sources of awareness that inform body distortion. First, the precision in the body metric may be based on the sight and positioning sense of a particular body segment. This view provides information on the dual nature of body representation, the reliability of a conscious body image, and implicit alterations in the metrics and positional correspondence of body parts. Second, body awareness may reflect an innate organizational experience of unity and continuity in the brain, with no strong isomorphism to body morphology. Third, body awareness may be based on efferent/afferent neural signals, suggesting that major body distortions may result from changes in neural sensorimotor experiences. All these views can be supported empirically, suggesting that body awareness is synthesized from multimodal integration and the temporal constancy of multiple body representations. For each of these views, we briefly discuss abnormalities and therapeutic strategies for correcting the bodily distortions in various clinical disorders.},

Neural correlates of key processes implicated in personal and social identity are reported from studies of children, adolescents, and adults, including autobiographical memory, direct and reﬂected self-appraisals, and social exclusion. While cortical midline structures of medial prefrontal cortex and medial posterior parietal cortex are consistently identiﬁed in neuroimaging studies considering personal identity from a primarily cognitive perspective (“who am I?”), additional regions are implicated by studies considering personal and social identity from a more socioemotional perspective (“what do others think about me, where do I ﬁt in?”), especially in child or adolescent samples. The involvement of these additional regions (including tempo–parietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, anterior insula, ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, middle cingulate cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) suggests mentalizing, emotion, and emotion regulation are central to self-development. In addition, these regions appear to function atypically during personal and social identity tasks in autism and depression, exhibiting a broad pattern of hypoactivation and hyperactivation, respectively.},

	abstract = {Objective: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric condition characterised by a distortion of body image. However, whether individuals with AN can accurately perceive the size of other individuals’ bodies is unclear. Method: In the current study, 24 women with AN and 24 healthy control participants undertook two biological motion tasks while eyetracking was performed: to identify the gender and to indicate the walkers’ body size. Results: Anorexia nervosa participants tended to ‘hyperscan’ stimuli but did not demonstrate differences in how visual attention was directed to different body areas, relative to controls. Groups also did not differ in their estimation of body size. Discussion: The hyperscanning behaviours suggest increased anxiety to disorder-relevant stimuli in AN. The lack of group difference in the estimation of body size suggests that the AN group was able to judge the body size of others accurately. The ﬁndings are discussed in terms of body image distortion speciﬁc to oneself in AN. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.},

The factors involved in the genesis and maintenance of AN are unclear, though the potential neurobiological underpinnings of the condition are of increasing interest. Through the investigation of functional connectivity of the brain at rest, information relating to neuronal communication and integration of information that may relate to behaviours and cognitive symptoms can be explored. The aim of this study was to investigate functional connectivity of the default mode network, and sensorimotor and visual networks in AN. 26 females with AN and 27 healthy control participants matched for age, gender and premorbid intelligence underwent a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Default mode network functional connectivity did not differ between groups. AN participants displayed reduced functional connectivity between the sensorimotor and visual networks, in comparison to healthy controls. This ﬁnding is discussed in terms of differences in visuospatial processing in AN and the distortion of body image experienced by these individuals. Overall, the ﬁndings suggest that sensorimotor and visual network connectivity may be related to visuospatial processing in AN, though, further research is required.},

	abstract = {Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed and Medline electronic database (1950–September 2009). Eligible studies were restricted to those involving the main parameters of cerebral activity and functional neuroimaging techniques. Findings of the reviewed studies have been grouped on a diagnostic subtype basis, and their comparison has been interpreted in terms of concordance.
Results: We found a high level of concordance among available studies with regard to the presence of frontal, parietal and cingulate functional disturbances in both anorexia nervosa restricting and binge/ purging subtypes. Concordance among studies conducted regardless of the anorexia nervosa subtypes suggests an alteration in temporal and parietal functions and striatal metabolism.
Conclusions: The most consistent alterations in anorexia nervosa cerebral activity seem to involve the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, the anterior cingulate cortex and the caudate nucleus. They may affect different neural systems such as the frontal visual system, the attention network, the arousal and emotional processing systems, the reward processing network, and the network for the body schema.},

The present study employed a novel adaptation of a computerized response time (RT) task to (i) assess implicit cognitive processing when exposed to the body of another individual, and (ii) examine individual differences in social comparative emotions that may influence the cognitive processing of human bodies. Adult females with low (n = 44) or high (n = 23) tendencies for comparative emotions completed a task in which they executed responses to coloured targets presented on the hands or feet of images of ultra-thin, average-size, and above average-size female models. Although the colour of the target is the only relevant target feature, it is typically found that the to-be-ignored location of the target on the body of the model influences RTs such that RTs are shorter when the target is on a body-part that is compatible with the responding limb (e.g., hand response when target was on hand) than on a body-part that is incompatible with the responding limb (e.g., hand response when target was on foot). Findings from the present study revealed that the magnitude of the body-part compatibility effect (i.e., the index of the cognitive processing of the model) was modulated by tendencies for affective body-related comparisons. Specifically, women who were prone to experiencing social comparative emotions demonstrated stronger and more consistent body-part compatibility effects across models. Therefore, women with higher social comparison tendencies have heightened processing of bodies at a neurocognitive level and may be at higher risk of the negative outcomes linked with physique-salient media exposure.},

Indeed in our everyday life the body we perceive does not conﬂict with the body we act with.

In his reply, Gadsby (2018) invited us to clarify how this co-construction works and to what extent the body schema and the body image can reshape each other. Here we motivate conceptual grounds for a model on which these two forms of representation modify one another and explore theoretical options for the way(s) in which they might do so. In particular, we highlight the virtues of a serial model in which the body schema has some primacy over the body image, while also acknowledging the special role played by the body image.},

Interoceptive sensitivity is considered to be an essential variable in emotional processes. The objective of the study was to elucidate this potential relationship and to clarify whether general interoceptive sensitivity is reduced in anorexia nervosa.
Methods: Using a heartbeat perception task, interoceptive sensitivity was assessed in 28 female patients with anorexia nervosa and 28 matched healthy controls. Questionnaires assessing interoceptive awareness (EDI) and several other variables were also administered.
Results: Patients with anorexia nervosa displayed significantly decreased interoceptive sensitivity. They also had more difficulties in interoceptive awareness.
Conclusions: In addition to a decreased ability to recognize certain visceral sensations related to hunger, there is a generally reduced capacity to accurately perceive bodily signals in anorexia nervosa. This highlights the potential importance of interoceptive sensitivity in the pathogenesis of eating disorders.},

Therefore, interoceptive processes were examined in twenty-three patients with current BN and were compared to healthy participants. We investigated Interoceptive Accuracy (IAc) assessed by the heartbeat detection task and Interoceptive Awareness (IA) assessed by the Eating Disorder Inventory-2. Patients with BN and healthy participants did not differ in terms of IAc when controlling for BMI, depression and anxiety, whereas IA among BN patients was found to have decreased. Although IAc and IA were not related among controls, we observed an inverse correlation in BN, suggesting that an abnormal overlap between these two levels of interoceptive signal processing is present in BN. The current study introduces a new perspective concerning the role of interoceptive processes in BN and generates further questions regarding the therapeutic utility of methods targeting the interaction between different levels of interoception in the treatment of BN.},

However, recently this relationship has been called into question. Indeed, despite a link between how we perceive and how we feel about our body seeming intuitive, until now lack of an experimental method to manipulate body size has meant that a causal link, even in healthy participants, has remained elusive. Recent developments in body perception research demonstrate that the perceptual experience of the body can be readily manipulated using multisensory illusions. The current study exploits such illusions to modulate perceived body size in an attempt to influence body satisfaction. Participants were presented with stereoscopic video images of slimmer and wider mannequin bodies viewed through headmounted displays from first person perspective. Illusory ownership was induced by synchronously stroking the seen mannequin body with the unseen real body. Pre and post-illusion affective and perceptual measures captured changes in perceived body size and body satisfaction. Illusory ownership of a slimmer body resulted in participants perceiving their actual body as slimmer and giving higher ratings of body satisfaction demonstrating a direct link between perceptual and affective body representations. Change in body satisfaction following illusory ownership of a wider body, however, was related to degree of (non-clinical) eating disorder psychopathology, which can be linked to fluctuating body representations found in clinical samples. The results suggest that body perception is linked to body satisfaction and may be of importance for eating disorder symptomology.},

However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying negative feelings toward the body and how they relate to body perception and eating-disorder pathology. Here, we used multisensory illusions to elicit illusory ownership of obese and slim bodies during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results implicate the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex in the development of negative feelings toward the body through functional interactions with the posterior parietal cortex, which mediates perceived obesity. Moreover, cingulate neural responses were modulated by nonclinical eating-disorder psychopathology and were attenuated in females. These results reveal how perceptual and affective body representations interact in the human brain and may help explain the neurobiological underpinnings of eating-disorder vulnerability in women.},

              Objectives:
              A rich body of literature has established the role of body image distortion and dissatisfaction in the development and maintenance of eating disorders. However, many of the currently used techniques require explicit comparison of the person’s body to an external stimulus. As the body schema is a largely unconscious construct, explicit comparison tasks may reflect a proxy, rather than the body schema itself.
              Methods:
              Here we use an implicit mental motor imagery (MMI) task to interrogate the body schema in healthy control participants (
              N
              =40) and participants at a residential eating disorder treatment center (
              N
              =42). By comparing the time it takes to imagine making a movement along a part of the body to the time it takes to actually make the same movement, we were able to assess participants’ mental image of their body (i.e., body schema).
              Results:
              We found that participants with eating disorders, but not healthy controls, exhibited distortions of the body schema such that they believed their abdomen, buttocks, and thighs to be larger than they really are. Additionally, the MMI task used here provided information above and beyond traditional self-report measures (i.e., Body Shape Questionnaire). Together the MMI task and traditional measures provide the most information.
              Conclusions:
              Findings using the novel MMI task are in line with the literature; participants with eating disorders consider themselves to be larger than they truly are. Taken together, results of this study suggest that MMI tasks provide complementary information to traditional self-report measures. (

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine 9-year trends and relationships regarding misperceptions of body size and dieting for weight loss among adolescents from 24 countries, and explore the inﬂuence of country-level overweight prevalence.
METHODS: Sociodemographic characteristics, body size perception and dieting for weight loss were assessed in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey conducted in 24 countries cross-sectionally at three time points (2001/2002, 2005/2006 and 2009/2010). Logistic regression models examined change over time in overestimation of body size in non-overweight adolescents, underestimation of body size in overweight adolescents, dieting for weight loss in non-overweight and overweight adolescents and relationships between body size perception and dieting. Analyses were stratiﬁed by weight status and sex. Covariates included country-level overweight prevalence, family afﬂuence and country level of development. Body mass index was only included in models examining dieting for weight loss.
RESULTS: Country-level overweight prevalence increased over time (11.6–14.7\%). Compared with Time 1, overweight adolescents had greater odds of body size underestimation at Time 3 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.68 for girls; OR = 1.10 for boys), whereas nonoverweight adolescents had lower odds of body size overestimation at Time 3 (OR = 0.87 for girls; OR = 0.89 for boys). Controlling for country-level overweight prevalence attenuated these relationships. Compared with Time 1, overweight and non-overweight boys were 10\% more likely to diet at Time 3, whereas overweight and non-overweight girls were 19\% and 16\%, respectively, less likely to diet at Time 3. Controlling for country-level overweight prevalence did not impact trends in dieting for weight loss. Additionally, the association of self-perceived overweight with increased odds of dieting diminished over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Body size perceptions among adolescents may have changed over time concurrent with shifts in country-level body weight. However, controlling for country-level overweight prevalence did not impact trends in dieting for weight loss, suggesting a potentially stronger impact of social comparison on weight-related perceptions than on behavior.

	abstract = {Background—Body image dissatisfaction (BID) is pervasive among patients presenting for bariatric surgery but significantly improves post-operatively. These findings are based primarily on studies of adults.
Objective—The objective of this study was to examine changes in BID among adolescents with extreme obesity from baseline/preoperative to 6 and 12 months following bariatric surgery using body size estimation. Setting—Pediatric Medical Center.
Methods—BID was prospectively assessed among 16 adolescent bariatric patients (Mage=16.3±1.2, MBMI=66.2±12.0, 67\% female) using a standard visual/perceptual measure [i.e., Stunkard Figure Rating Scale. Participants identified Current and Ideal body size, with a discrepancy score (Current – Ideal) indicating BID. Body size estimation ratings were compared to attitudinal (i.e., IWQOL-Kids: Body Esteem and Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents: Physical Appearance) body image scores, BMI (kg/m2), and Total weight-related quality of life (WRQOL).
Results—There was a significant reduction in Current body size (7.9 to 6.4, p{\textless}.001) from baseline to 6 months but not from 6 to 12 months. Current body size was related to BMI and \%EWL but not attitudinal body image at each time point. Smaller Discrepancy (Current – Ideal) was associated with higher Total WRQOL (r=−0.68), with a trend towards significance for Body Esteem (r=−0.65) at 12 months.
Conclusions—Adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery experience significantly decreased BID within the first 12 months post-surgery, with the most substantial change between baseline and 6 months. Post-operative WRQOL is more closely associated to body size discrepancy than current body size.},

Biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors have been found to be relevant in understanding the development of body image concerns and weight loss strategies among children. However, these factors have not been examined together in a single study; thus, the relative influence of each factors and how these factors may interact is not known. In the current study, body mass index (BMI) was found to be a good indicator of girls’ and boys’ body dissatisfaction, while the main indicator of children’s body change strategies was perceived pressure from parents, peers, and the media. Overall, there were more similarities than differences between girls and boys. The age between 8 and 11 years is a significant period to commence studying body image concerns and body change strategies, as it can be used to help us understand the emergence of gender differences in children’s weight and muscle concerns.},

Results showed a highly signiﬁcant positive correlation (r = .775, p {\textbackslash} .001) between number of autistic traits and the frequency of sensory processing problems.

	abstract = {Objective: Body image dissatisfaction is as well a risk factor for eating disorders (ED) and a central feature of ED. The exact nature of body image in adolescent ED is still debated. This study examined attitudinal body image in adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), and the association of age, maturational timing, duration of eating disorder, actual weight and general psychological distress with the attitudinal body image in ED. Methods: The study group consisted of an outpatient clinical sample of adolescents attending for assessment because of eating disorders. The attitudinal body image of 57 adolescents (girls) aged 14-21 years was studied at the beginning of the treatment. The attitudes to body shape, body size, appearance, tone and femininity were studied by a Likert format scale and by the body dissatisfaction (BD) and drive for thinness scales (DT) from EDI-2 inventory. Results: Bulimics reported more body image dissatisfaction than anorectics. In multivariate analyses BN and higher general psychological distress had strong associations with body image dissatisfaction. Longer duration of ED and earlier menarche were also associated with negative body image. Discussion: Attitudinal body image differs between adolescent AN and BN. The psychological distress has a great impact on body image in ED, which should be taken into account in assessment and in treatment interventions.},

	abstract = {The central disturbance in anorexia nervosa (AN) is a distorted body image. This perceptual error does not extend to judging others’ body shapes. We used fMRI to examine if the brain processing of an image of self is different in the brains of AN patients. The sample comprised 10 patients with AN and 10 healthy control women. In a controlled epoch design, subjects were presented with images of self and non-self, matched for body mass index (BMI), in a counter-balanced fashion, and echoplanar images with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast were obtained on a 3T Philips scanner. Processing of nonself-images by control subjects activated the inferior and middle frontal gyri, superior and inferior parietal lobules, posterior lobe of the cerebellum and the thalamus. Patients had a similar pattern of activation with greater activation in the medial frontal gyrus. When the two groups were contrasted for the differential activation with self vs. non-self-images, control subjects had greater activation than patients in the middle frontal gyri, insula, precuneus, and occipital regions while the patients did not have greater activation in any region. AN patients had no signiﬁcant regions of activation with self-images compared to baseline. We conclude that AN patients process non-self-images similarly to control subjects, but their processing of self-images is quite discrepant, with a lack of activation of the attentional system or the insula. Such discrepant emotional and perceptual processing may underlie the distortion of self-images by AN patients. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The percentage of over- or underestimation was calculated for pictures of the subject, other persons and a neutral object. The Eating Disorders Inventory for Children (EDI-C) was also completed. Among adolescents at risk of eating problems, girls tended to overestimate their own body size while boys showed a pattern of underestimation, compared to a relatively accurate body perception for low-risk subjects. The groups did not differ in the perception of the neutral object. Important predictors of perceived body size included the size estimation of other children, preoccupation with weight and shape, self-esteem, and emotional instability. The results support the predictive value of body size estimation. Gender differences in judgement bias can be interpreted within present aesthetic ideals and their relation to self perception, body image, and eating problems in adolescence.},

	abstract = {Obese people's distortions in visually-based mental body-parts representations have been reported in previous studies, but other sensory modalities have largely been neglected. In the present study, we investigated possible differences in tactilely-based body-parts representation between an obese and a healthy-weight group; additionally we explore the possible relationship between the tactile- and the visually-based body representation. Participants were asked to estimate the distance between two tactile stimuli that were simultaneously administered on the arm or on the abdomen, in the absence of visual input. The visually-based body-parts representation was investigated by a visual imagery method in which subjects were instructed to compare the horizontal extension of body part pairs. According to the results, the obese participants overestimated the size of the tactilely-perceived distances more than the healthy-weight group when the arm, and not the abdomen, was stimulated. Moreover, they reported a lower level of accuracy than did the healthy-weight group when estimating horizontal distances relative to their bodies, conﬁrming an inappropriate visually-based mental body representation. Our results imply that body representation disturbance in obese people is not limited to the visual mental domain, but it spreads to the tactilely perceived distances. The inaccuracy was not a generalized tendency but was body-part related.},

Methods: To shed light on this issue, we asked individuals aﬀected by obesity to process dimensions of their own body in a real action: they walked in a straight-ahead direction, while avoiding collision with obstacles represented by door-like openings that varied in width.
Results: Participants aﬀected by obesity showed a body rotation behavior similar to that of the healthy weighted, but diﬀerences emerged in parameters such as step length and velocity.
Conclusion: When participants with obesity walk through door-like openings, their body parts rotation is scaled according to their physical body dimensions; however, they might try to minimize risk of collision. Our study is in line with the hypothesis that unconscious body-scaled actions are related to emotional, cognitive and perceptual components of a negative body image.},

Interoception, the ability to detect and attend to internal bodily sensations, has been found to moderate the experience of body ownership, a known difference in ASD that may affect social function. However, interoception has not been empirically examined in ASD. In the current study, 45 children (21 with ASD and 24 controls) ages 8 to 17 years completed a heartbeat perception paradigm as a measure of interoceptive ability. A subset of these children also completed the rubber hand illusion task, a multisensory paradigm probing the malleability of perceived body ownership. Although the heartbeat perception paradigm yielded comparable interoceptive awareness (IA) overall across both groups, children with ASD were superior at mentally tracking their heartbeats over longer intervals, suggesting increased sustained attention to internal cues in ASD. In addition, IA was negatively correlated with rubber hand illusion susceptibility in both groups, supporting a previously demonstrated inverse relationship between internal awareness and one’s ability to incorporate external stimuli into one’s perception of self. We propose a trade-off between attention to internal cues and attention to external cues, whereby attentional resources are disproportionately allocated to internal, rather than external, sensory cues in ASD.},

Method: A total of 129 patients with eating disorders (Mage ¼ 16.0 Æ 1.8) and 354 healthy control participants (CP) (Mage ¼ 15.2 Æ 2.1) completed the EDI-2 and were asked to estimate the circumference of selected body parts by using string (BID-CA).
Results: CP showed an average overestimation of 8–16\%, depending on the estimated body part. Eating disorder patients overestimated their body parts on average by about 30\%. Thigh and waist estimations were the best variables for discriminating between patients with eating disorders and CP. No signiﬁcant differences were found between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa patients.
Conclusions: Body image distortion plays an important role in both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The BID-CA is well suited to discriminate between healthy and disordered overestimation of body parts. Copyright \# 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.},

Negative emotional experiences alter one’s behavioral, psychological, and physiological reactions in social interactions. This study compared affective and autonomic nervous system responses to social interactions in Germany and American Samoa, two societies with different body-size related norms. German (n = 55) and Samoan (n = 56) volunteers with and without obesity participated in a virtual ball-tossing game that comprised episodes of social inclusion and social exclusion. During the experiment, heart rate was measured and parasympathetic activity (i.e., high-frequency heart rate variability) was analyzed. We found differences in both emotional experience and autonomic cardio-regulation between the two cultures: during social inclusion, Germans but not Samoans showed increased parasympathetic activity. In Germans with obesity, this increase was related to a more negative body image (comprising high rates of weight-related teasing). During social exclusion, Samoans showed parasympathetic withdrawal regardless of obesity status, while Germans with obesity showed a stronger increase in parasympathetic activity than lean Germans. Furthermore, we found fewer obesity-related differences in emotional arousal after social exclusion in Samoans as compared to Germans. Investigating the interplay of socio-cultural, psychological, and biological aspects, our results suggest inﬂuences of body size-related socio-cultural norms on parasympathetic cardioregulation and negative emotions during social interactions.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with a computer-based life image distortion technique, we stimulated female anorectic patients and healthy controls with digital pictures of their own body image, individually distorted by themselves. In anorectic patients, stimulation with their own body image was associated with activation in the right amygdala, the right gyrus fusiformis and the brainstem region. Our preliminary ﬁndings indicate an activation of the brain’s ‘fear network’ and underscore the need for examination of body image distortions in anorectic patients with a fMRI design to further evaluate the course of this disturbance in a longitudinal approach. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

We propose that interventions that comprise of virtual reality (VR) multisensory feedback training provide a promising new avenue for the treatment of chronic pain. Thus far, VR-based interventions have been primarily applied to distract patients from pain. Recently, ﬁrst attempts have been made to apply VR-based interventions as active sensory feedback training. VR-based feedback training allows the dynamic modiﬁcation of virtual limbs that are perceived as one’s own. This offers unique opportunities to target long-term associations between sensory input and pain in patients with chronic pain. We predict that multisensory VR feedback interventions could be effective in reducing fear-avoidance behavior and improving distorted body images. We review current developments and provide an outlook on future directions in the promising ﬁeld of VR feedback interventions for the multisensory treatment of chronic pain.},

In a previous article, Michael Males mounted a challenge to this body of work, arguing that it exaggerated the propensity of young people to take risks and ignored the impact of external contextual and sociological factors. In responding to Males’s article, this article not only supports his concern about deficit models of adolescence but also explores the way that the new brain science takes us beyond the century-old binary between biological determinism and social constructionism. It calls for renewed scholarly effort to develop theory and discourse that will allow us to think about young people’s responses in terms of the interaction between biology, experience and social context, and individual agency.},

Results: This new method assessed the perception of body size under conditions that resembled the real-life situation of viewing oneself in a mirror. Participants with eating disorders signi®cantly overestimated their body size relative to controls (p {\textless} .05) and tended to be more dissatisfied with their body size (p  .07). Discussion: It is argued that the new method assesses the perception of body size, is ecologically valid, and is the most clinically relevant of the methods developed to date.

Method Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate 13 men and13 women during an emotional decision taskconsisting of unpleasant words concerning body image and neutral words.
Results The left medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated only among men, and the left amygdala was activated only among women during the task; activation in the apical prefrontal region was significantly greater in men than in women.
Conclusions Our data suggestthatthe prefrontal region is responsible for the gender differences in the processing of words concerning body image, and may also be responsible for gender differences in susceptibility to eating disorders.},

Nederkoorn, and S. Mulkens (2005) showed that eating disorder patients attend relatively more to their own unattractive body parts, whereas healthy controls attend relatively more to their own attractive body parts. In 2 studies, we investigated whether this bias in selective attention is causal to body dissatisfaction and whether an experimentally induced bias for attractive body parts might lead to increased body satisfaction in women who are highly dissatisfied with their bodies. Design: We used a betweensubjects design in which participants were trained to attend to either their self-defined unattractive body parts or their self-defined attractive body parts by use of an eye tracker. Main Outcome Measures: State body and weight satisfaction. Results: Inducing a temporary attentional bias for self-defined unattractive body parts led to a significant decrease in body satisfaction and teaching body-dissatisfied women to attend to their own attractive body parts led to a significant increase in body satisfaction. Conclusion: Selective attention for unattractive body parts can play a role in the development of body dissatisfaction, and changing the way one looks may be a new way for improving body dissatisfaction in women.},

Participants were asked to mentally scan across two body widths (e.g. hips and shoulders) and to decide as quickly as possible which one was longer or shorter. If the mental representation accessed to make such comparisons is visual, an inverse relation would be expected between RT and distance difference on the body to be judged (i.e. actual difference in size between the two body widths), with accuracy increasing with increasing distance difference. Females with high body shape concern (scoring high on the Body Shape Questionnaire: BSQ, n = 23) were compared to females with low body shape concern (scoring low on the BSQ, n = 19).},

Evidence from somatoperception studies point to a generic disturbances of somatosensory components of body representations. Here we have investigated whether AN patients (N ¼18) and controls differed in the perception of tactile stimuli differently oriented along the body axes. We tested the hypothesis that patients perceive and represent their body selectively larger in only one dimension. To this aim we used elementary tactile measures for tactile acuity (Von Frey's test and two-point discrimination thresholds –2 PD) and tactile discrimination measures. The rationale is based on the assumption that AN patients have a wider body representation, and that tactile body representation tasks (Tactile Distance task) oriented across the bodies (horizontally) are inﬂuenced by distorted body representations compared with tactile stimuli oriented along the bodies (vertically) which should not be inﬂuenced by body representations. Results showed that patients judged horizontal tactile stimuli signiﬁcantly wider than the same stimuli oriented vertically.These results suggest that human brain perceives things differently based on body representations and that the beliefs concerning body size inﬂuence the speciﬁc somatosensory process of tactile experience.},

In the most recent case, in 2012, a ruling prohibited states from mandating life without parole for crimes committed by minors. In these cases, the Court drew on scientific studies of the adolescent brain in concluding that adolescents, by virtue of their inherent psychological and neurobiological immaturity, are not as responsible for their behaviour as adults. This article discusses the Court’s rationale in these cases and the role of scientific evidence about adolescent brain development in its decisions. I conclude that the neuroscientific evidence was probably persuasive to the Court not because it revealed something new about the nature of adolescence but precisely because it aligned with common sense and behavioural science.},

Underestimation of body size might represent a barrier to prevention and treatment of overweight; thus insight in how underestimation of body size develops and tracks through the childhood years is needed. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine stability in children’s underestimation of body size, exploring predictors of underestimation over time. The prospective path from underestimation to BMI was also tested. In a Norwegian cohort of 6 year olds, followed up at ages 8 and 10 (analysis sample: n = 793) body size estimation was captured by the Children’s Body Image Scale, height and weight were measured and BMI calculated. Overall, children were more likely to underestimate than overestimate their body size. Individual stability in underestimation was modest, but signiﬁcant. Higher BMI predicted future underestimation, even when previous underestimation was adjusted for, but there was no evidence for the opposite direction of inﬂuence. Boys were more likely than girls to underestimate their body size at ages 8 and 10 (age 8: 38.0\% vs. 24.1\%; Age 10: 57.9\% vs. 30.8\%) and showed a steeper increase in underestimation with age compared to girls. In conclusion, the majority of 6, 8, and 10-year olds correctly estimate their body size (prevalence ranging from 40 to 70\% depending on age and gender), although a substantial portion perceived themselves to be thinner than they actually were. Higher BMI forecasted future underestimation, but underestimation did not increase the risk for excessive weight gain in middle childhood.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that the representation of the hand is distorted. When participants are asked to localize unseen points on the hand (e.g. the knuckle), it is perceived to be wider and shorter than its physical dimensions. Similar distortions occur when people are asked to judge the distance between two tactile points on the hand; estimates made in the longitudinal direction are perceived as signiﬁcantly shorter than those made in the transverse direction. Yet, when asked to visually compare the shape and size of one's own hand to a template hand, individuals are accurate at estimating the size of their own hands. Thus, it seems that body representations are, at least in part, a function of the most prominent underlying sensory modality used to perceive the body part. Yet, it remains unknown if the representations of other body parts are similarly distorted. The lower limbs, for example, are structurally and functionally very diﬀerent from the hands, yet their representation(s) are seldom studied. What does the body representation for the leg look like? And is leg representation dependent on which sense is probed when making judgments about its shape and size? In the current study, we investigated what the representation of the leg looks like in visually-, tactually-, and proprioceptively-guided tasks. Results revealed that the leg, like the hand, is distorted in a highly systematic manner. Distortions seem to rely, at least partly, on sensory input. This is the ﬁrst study, to our knowledge, to systematically investigate leg representation in healthy individuals.},

	abstract = {Body processing has been associated functionally to the so called extrastriate body area (EBA) which is located in the lateral occipital cortex. As body image disturbance is one of the main diagnostic criteria in anorexia nervosa (AN) this study aimed at looking for alterations in gray matter density in women with (AN) especially in the EBA. High resolution T1 images from 15 women with AN and 15 age matched healthy controls women were contrasted using voxel based morphometry (VBM). Additionally functional localizer scans were used to determine functionally the EBA of each participant. In general, total gray matter volumes did differ between groups. VBM results yielded evidence for a reduction of gray matter density in the left EBA. This reduction, which resulted from whole brain analysis, was localised within the activation cluster of the EBA localizer scan. The current results provide for the ﬁrst time evidence for structural alterations in the EBA in patients with AN which might suggest that body image distortion is related at least in part to structural alteration in the EBA.},

Ten women diagnosed with AN and 15 healthy, age matched controls were investigated using fMRI during viewing images of bodies and chairs. Effective connectivity between cortical areas which are involved in human visual body processing was accessed. Effective connectivity analysis yielded evidence for a different network in AN and healthy controls during visual processing of human bodies. Left sided effective connectivity in the occipital cortex of women with AN showed a highly negative correlation with body size misjudgment. Present results yield evidence for altered networks for body processing in women with AN. Results explain body size misjudgment, a key feature in AN, which seems to be based on reduced effective connectivity in the body processing network.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Persistent pain is a pervasive condition that is often associated with a distorted body image. Most research into pain and body image investigated neural or physiological correlates (e.g. phantom limb pain), and much less is known about the psychological experience of body image changes in response to pain such as appearance concerns. The aim was to examine body image concerns in people with persistent pain, in particular appearance concerns and related coping behaviours and appearance-related emotions such as anger and shame.
Methods: Design was cross-sectional and data was collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews with people suffering from persistent musculoskeletal pain (n = 7; six females; age = 19–56), and analysed with inductive thematic analysis (TA).
Results: Two main themes were identified: “Relationship to the painful body” and “Dissatisfaction with the body”, each containing three subthemes, along with the sidetheme “Appearance concerns affected by pain and mood”. All participants reported appearance concerns, predominantly about their weight and related coping behaviours such as avoidance of mirrors, exercising or dieting and pain-induced mood changes that were associated with a negative body image.
Conclusions: People with persistent pain report appearance concerns, often related to pain-induced negative mood changes, and reduced functioning. It remains unclear to what extent attitudes towards the body change over time in accordance with pain. A wider concept},

	abstract = {Several recent reports have shown that even healthy adults maintain highly distorted representations of the size and shape of their body. These distortions have been shown to be highly consistent across different study designs and dependent measures. However, previous studies have found that visual judgments of size can be modulated by the experimental instructions used, for example, by asking for judgments of the participant’s subjective experience of stimulus size (i.e., apparent instructions) versus judgments of actual stimulus properties (i.e., objective instructions). Previous studies investigating internal body representations have relied exclusively on ‘apparent’ instructions. Here, we investigated whether apparent versus objective instructions modulate findings of distorted body representations underlying position sense (Exp. 1), tactile distance perception (Exp. 2), as well as the conscious body image (Exp. 3). Our results replicate the characteristic distortions previously reported for each of these tasks and further show that these distortions are not affected by instruction type (i.e., apparent vs. objective). These results show that the distortions measured with these paradigms are robust to differences in instructions and do not reflect a dissociation between perception and belief.},

	abstract = {Previous literature suggests that a disturbed ability to accurately identify own body size may contribute to overweight. Here, we investigated the influence of personal body size, indexed by body mass index (BMI), on body size estimation in a non-clinical population of females varying in BMI. We attempted to disentangle general biases in body size estimates and attitudinal influences by manipulating whether participants believed the body stimuli (personalized avatars with realistic weight variations) represented their own body or that of another person. Our results show that the accuracy of own body size estimation is predicted by personal BMI, such that participants with lower BMI underestimated their body size and participants with higher BMI overestimated their body size. Further, participants with higher BMI were less likely to notice the same percentage of weight gain than participants with lower BMI. Importantly, these results were only apparent when participants were judging a virtual body that was their own identity (Experiment 1), but not when they estimated the size of a body with another identity and the same underlying body shape (Experiment 2a). The different influences of BMI on accuracy of body size estimation and sensitivity to weight change for self and other identity suggests that effects of BMI on visual body size estimation are self-specific and not generalizable to other bodies.},

	abstract = {The conscious representation of our physical appearance is important for many aspects of everyday life. Here, we asked whether different visual experiences of our bodies influence body width estimates. In Experiment 1, width estimates of three body parts (foot, hips, and shoulders) without any visual access were compared to estimates with visual feedback available in a mirror or from a first-person perspective. In the no visual access and mirror condition, participants additionally estimated their head width. There was no influence of viewing condition on body part width estimates. Consistent with previous research, all body part widths were overestimated with greater overestimation of hip and head width. In Experiment 2, participants estimated the size of unfamiliar noncorporeal objects to test whether this overestimation was partially due to the metric body size estimation method or our experimental conditions. Object width was overestimated with visual feedback in a mirror available as compared to when directly looking at the object, but only for objects placed at shoulder and head height. We conclude that at least some of the overestimation of body part width seems to be body specific and occurs regardless of the visual information provided about the own body.},

Two assessment scales were used, the Body Awareness Scale –Health (BAS-H), based on observations and the Interview Scale Body Ego (ISBE). Total scales and subscales were compared. Altogether 87 ED patients (Total Group, TG) were assessed. Twenty-six patients had anorexia nervosa (AN), 20 bulimia nervosa (BN) and 41 patients ED not otherwise speciﬁed (EDNOS). Signiﬁcant correlations between total BAS-H and total ISBE (r ϭ 0.48–0.57) were found for AN, EDNOS and TG groups. In the subscale centring, correlations were found for all groups (r ϭ 0.42–0.60). In the subscale relations, correlations were found for AN, EDNOS and TG groups (r ϭ 0.43–0.60). The ED patients were characterized by withheld breathing and restrictive expressions of body movements and emotions. Body awareness and self-awareness seemed to be reduced.

	abstract = {Body sensations play an essential role in the subjective evaluation of our physical health, illness, and healing. They are impacted by peripheral somatic and external processes, but they are also heavily modulated by mental processes, e.g., attention, motor control, and emotion. Body sensations, such as tingling, numbness, pulse, and warmth, can emerge due to simply focusing attention on a body part. It is however an open question, if these sensations are connected with actual peripheral changes or happen “only in the mind.” Here, we ﬁrst tested whether the intensity of such attention-related body sensations is related to autonomic and somatomotor physiological processes and to psychological traits. In this study, attention-related body sensations were not signiﬁcantly connected to changes in physiology, except warmth sensation, which was linked to decrease in muscle tension. Overall intensity of tingling signiﬁcantly correlated with body awareness and tendentiously with body–mind practice. This strengthened the hypothesis that attention-related body sensations are more the result of top–down functions, and the connection with peripheral processes is weak. Here, we suggested a novel protocol to examine the effect of manipulating attention on body sensations, which together with our results and discussion can inspire future researches.},

	abstract = {Body image disturbance has been listed as a diagnostic feature of several psychopathological conditions [1-5]. As body image concerns appear in children as young as 5 years old, it was hypothesized to be an important risk factor for the development of psychopathology, such as Eating Disorders (ED) in adolescence. Results of the current review of the literature support this hypothesis and suggest that young children can (1) estimate as accurately as adults their body size, and (2) show similar cognitive distortions, cognitive biases, and the negative emotions associated with their body image. There is some evidence that children can (1) display severe symptoms of body image distortion such as is present in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), (2) demonstrate negative stereotypes toward obesity and (3) internalize thin ideal body image. Research suggests that some of the key factors involved in children’s body satisfaction is parental perception and direct comments from peers. Body dissatisfaction can predict body image related psychopathology later in development. In conclusion, intervention and prevention of eating disorders with children under the age of 7 is arguably a viable strategy, and cognitive and behavioural training could involve parents, teachers, mental health practitioners as well as the child him/herself. This training and education should cover early manifestation of body image disturbance and their associated risk factors.},

	abstract = {The exact relation between the sense that one’s body is one’s own (body-ownership) and the sense that one controls one’s own bodily actions (agency) has been the focus of much speculation, but remains unclear. On an ‘additive’ model, agency and body-ownership are strongly related; the ability to control actions is a powerful cue to body-ownership. This view implies a component common to the senses of body-ownership and agency, plus possible additional components unique to agency. An alternative ‘independence’ model holds that agency and body-ownership are qualitatively different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and recruiting distinct brain networks. We tested these two speciﬁc models by investigating the sensory and motor aspects of body-representation in the brain using fMRI. Activations in midline cortical structures were associated with a sensory-driven sense of body-ownership, and were absent in agency conditions. Activity in the pre-SMA was linked to the sense of agency, but distinct from the sense of body-ownership. No shared activations that would support the additive model were found. The results support the independence model. Body-ownership involves a psychophysiological baseline, linked to activation of the brain’s default mode network. Agency is linked to premotor and parietal areas involved in generating motor intentions and subsequent action monitoring.},

	abstract = {Empirical research on the bodily self has only recently started to investigate how the link between a body and the experience of this body as mine is developed, maintained or disturbed. The Rubber Hand Illusion has been used as a model instance of the normal sense of embodiment to investigate the processes that underpin the experience of body-ownership. This review puts forward a neurocognitive model according to which body-ownership arises as an interaction between current multisensory input and internal models of the body. First, a pre-existing stored model of the body distinguishes between objects that may or may not be part of one’s body. Second, on-line anatomical and postural representations of the body modulate the integration of multisensory information that leads to the recalibration of visual and tactile coordinate systems. Third, the resulting referral of tactile sensation will give rise to the subjective experience of body-ownership. These processes involve a neural network comprised of the right temporoparietal junction which tests the incorporeability of the external object, the secondary somatosensory cortex which maintains an on-line representation of the body, the posterior parietal and ventral premotor cortices which code for the recalibration of the hand-centred coordinate systems, and the right posterior insula which underpins the subjective experience of body-ownership. The experience of body-ownership may represent a critical component of self-speciﬁcity as evidenced by the different ways in which multisensory integration in interaction with internal models of the body can actually manipulate important physical and psychological aspects of the self.},

One fundamental dimension of the bodily self is the sense of body ownership that refers to the special perceptual status of one’s own body, the feeling that “my body” belongs to me. The primary aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances in the study of body ownership and our understanding of the underlying neurocognitive processes in three ways. I ﬁrst consider how the sense of body ownership has been investigated and elucidated in the context of multisensory integration. Beyond exteroception, recent studies have considered how this exteroceptively driven sense of body ownership can be linked to the other side of embodiment, that of the unobservable, yet felt, interoceptive body, suggesting that these two sides of embodiment interact to provide a unifying bodily self. Lastly, the multisensorial understanding of the self has been shown to have implications for our understanding of social relationships, especially in the context of self–other boundaries. Taken together, these three research strands motivate a uniﬁed model of the self inspired by current predictive coding models.},

	abstract = {Physicians, nurses, psychologists, and other medical professionals need to understand patients’ psychological issues, such as anxiety and depression, in order to most effectively care for their patients. Particularly, those involved in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders, in which the chief symptoms are abnormal emotional states, should understand the psychological and behavioral issues related to the patient’s state of maladjustment. In addition, an understanding of brain dysfunction and other physiological mechanisms, which cause these psychological maladies, is important for appropriately assessing the patient’s emotional well-being in order to regulate the patient’s emotional state and implement the most effective treatment strategy. This chapter introduces the concept of Psychophysiology, a research approach that strives to understand human emotion, cognition, and other psychological and behavioral phenomena from a physiological perspective. The advent of functional neuroimaging technologies beginning with positron emission tomography (PET) in the 1980s and the subsequent development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the 1990s brought new methods to this ﬁeld of psychological research. When coupled with advancements in neuroscience, the psychophysiological approach exhibits even greater potential. This book strives to further the understanding of the mechanisms underlying emotion and presents potential strategies for the development of better methods to regulate emotion. In doing so, this chapter will discuss how the psychophysiological approach is valuable for elucidating the pathology of mental disorders, therapeutic mechanisms, and other key concepts in psychiatry. This discussion will further emphasize the important association of psychophysiology with neuroscientiﬁc approaches.},

Methods: Brain responses to line drawings of underweight, normal weight, and overweight female bodies were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 9 women with bulimia nervosa, 13 with anorexia nervosa, and 18 healthy women. Participants rated the stimuli for fear and disgust.
Results: In the three groups, the lateral fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex were activated in response to body shapes compared with the control condition (drawings of houses). The responses in the lateral fusiform gyrus and in the parietal cortex were less strong in patients with eating disorders compared with healthy control subjects. Patients with eating disorders rated the body shapes in all weight categories as more aversive than did healthy women. In the group with eating disorders, the aversion ratings correlated positively with activity in the right medial apical prefrontal cortex.
Conclusions: Processing of female body shapes engages a distributed neural network, parts of which are underactive in women with eating disorders. The considerable variability in subjective emotional reaction to body shapes in patients with eating disorders is associated with differential activity in the prefrontal cortex.},

Here, we investigated whether evaluating self- and mother-traits in three domains (physical, academic, prosocial) relies on similar or distinct brain regions. Additionally, we explored the topical discussion in the literature on whether vmPFC activity during self-evaluations is induced by valence or importance of traits. Participants evaluated themselves and their mothers on positive and negative traits in three domains. Across all domains, evaluating traits resulted in right dlPFC, left middle temporal cortex, bilateral thalamus, and right insula activity. For physical traits, we found speciﬁc neural activity in brain regions typically implicated in mentalizing (dmPFC, IPL). For academic traits, we found a brain region typically implicated in autobiographical memories (PCC), and for prosocial traits, social brain regions (temporal pole, TPJ) were activated. Importantly, these patterns were found for both self and mother evaluations. Regarding valence, rACC/vmPFC showed stronger activation for positive than for negative traits. Interestingly, activation in this region was stronger for highly important traits compared to low/neutral important traits. Thus, this study shows that distinct neural processes are activated for evaluating positive and negative traits in diﬀerent domains.},

	abstract = {Background: Dance discipline could modulate the presence of alterations in body image, which is a factor relationship with eating disorders.
Objective: To analyze the body image distortion and dissatisfaction in student dancers based on dance discipline.
Methods: Two hundred and ninety-eight preadolescents, adolescents and young classical, contemporary and Spanish dancers took part in the study. Participants self-fulfilled the “silhouette scale for adolescents” in order to determine the perceived and ideal image. The real body image was calculated with the body mass index data (BMI). After that, distortion index, dissatisfaction index and the relation between real and ideal image were calculated.
Results: About distortion index, classical and contemporary dancers perceived themselves with a higher BMI than they had, whereas Spanish dance showed the opposite tendency. Significant differences among classical dancers and the other modalities were found (p {\textless} 0.017). Based on distortion index results, ten dancers showed a high risk for developing an eating disorder. In the dissatisfaction index, all disciplines selected as ideal to be thinner as they perceived themselves, without significant differences. About the real/ideal index, contemporary and Spanish dancers considered as ideal silhouettes with a lower BMI than they had. Classical dancers showed the opposite tendency, with significant differences among this group and the others (p {\textless} 0.017).
Conclusions: Most dancers have a self-image which is not related with the reality. This could act as a factor which induce eating disorders. Recibido: 03/03/2017 Aceptado: 08/04/2017},

Interestingly, higher SES was positively correlated with self-reported trait empathy, suggesting that those higher in status may not realize that they are actually lower in empathy.

	abstract = {Objectives: Body image distortion is a core symptom of anorexia nervosa (AN), which involves alterations in self- (and other’s) evaluative processes arising during body perception. At a neural level, self-related information is thought to rely on areas of the so-called default mode network (DMN), which, additionally, shows prominent synchronised activity at rest.
Methods: Twenty female patients with AN and 20 matched healthy controls were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging when: (a) viewing video clips of their own body and another's body; (b) at rest. Between-group differences within the DMN during task performance were evaluated and further explored for task-related and resting-state-related functional connectivity alterations.
Results: AN patients showed a hyperactivation of the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex during their own-body processing but a response failure to another’s body processing at the precuneus and ventral PCC. Increased task-related connectivity was found between dPCC–dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus–mid-temporal cortex. Further, AN patients showed decreased resting-state connectivity between the dPCC and the angular gyrus.
Conclusions: The PCC and the precuneus are suggested as key components of a network supporting self–other-evaluative processes implicated in body distortion, while the existence of DMN alterations at rest might reflect a sustained, task-independent breakdown within this network in AN.},

	abstract = {Appearance-based social comparison has been found to be both a risk and maintenance factor for body dissatisfaction. However, the brain mechanism involved in appearance-based social comparison has rarely been investigated. Utilizing ecologically valid pictorial stimuli depicting fat and thin female bodies, the current study investigated the temporal dynamics of brain activity underlying upward social comparison (viewing fat bodies) and downward social comparison (viewing slim bodies) as well as the modulating eﬀects of body dissatisfaction and person perspective (with cues of “I am …her” or “She is …me”). Thirty-one young women participated in this study, during which they compared their own body sizes with the ones presented on the screen while their EEGs were recorded. The results showed that downward comparison elicited larger N1 amplitudes than upward comparison, suggesting an attentional vigilance to fat bodies during early processing stages in downward comparison. However, these eﬀects were only obtained in the ﬁrst-person perspective. Meanwhile, women with great body dissatisfaction showed initial attentional orienting biases toward fatness-related stimuli, which was indexed by the N2 components. During the late processing stages, upward comparison was processed faster and ﬁnished earlier than downward comparison. The modulating eﬀects of body dissatisfaction were observed during the late processing stages as indexed by late positive components, suggesting an attentional maintenance on fat bodies and attentional avoidance of attractive thin bodies. Furthermore, compared with the ﬁrst-person perspective, enhanced processing of both types of female bodies in the third-person perspective was observed during late processing stages. The current observations indicate patterns of hypervigilance-maintenance processing of fat bodies underlying downward comparison as well as hypervigilance-avoidance processing of slim bodies underlying upward comparison. Enhanced brain sensitivity to and attentional maintenance on fat body shapes might be important neural mechanisms that underlie body dissatisfaction or even body image disturbance among young women.},

Here we aim to explore brain disturbances underlying extraversion and neuroticism in 87 healthy individuals using fractional amplitude of low-frequency ﬂuctuations (LFF) on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two different frequency bands, Slow-5 (0.01–0.027 Hz) exhibiting higher power and involving larger brain regions, and Slow-4 (0.027–0.073 Hz) exhibiting less power and emerging locally, were analyzed. Our results showed a positive correlation between LFF amplitude at Slow-5 and extraversion in medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, important portions of the default mode network, thus suggesting a link between default network activity and personality traits. LFF amplitude at Slow-5 was correlated positively with neuroticism in right posterior portion of the frontal lobe, further validating neuroticism with frontal lateralization. In addition, LFF amplitude at Slow-4 was negatively associated with extraversion and neuroticism in left hippocampus (HIP) and bilateral superior temporal cortex (STC) respectively, supporting the hypothesized (inverse) relationship between extraversion and resting arousal, also implying neural circuit underlying emotional process inﬂuencing on personality. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest the important relationships, between personality and LFF amplitude dynamic, depend on speciﬁc frequency bands. Hum Brain Mapp 35:331–339, 2014.

In this study, we explored the effect of task-irrelevant emotional facial expressions on judgments of body weight and the relationship between emotion-induced weight judgment bias and other psychosocial variables including attitudes toward obese persons. Forty-four participants were asked to quickly make binary body weight decisions for 960 randomized sad and neutral faces of varying weight levels presented on a computer screen. The results showed that sad facial expressions systematically decreased the decision threshold of overweight judgments for male faces. This perceptual decision bias by emotional expressions was positively correlated with the belief that being overweight is not under the control of obese persons. Our results provide experimental evidence that task-irrelevant emotional expressions can systematically change the decision threshold for weight judgments, demonstrating that sad expressions can make faces appear more overweight than they would otherwise be judged.},

	abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an illness that frequently begins during adolescence and involves weight loss. Two groups of adolescent girls (AN-A, weight-recovered following AN) and (HC-A, healthy comparison) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task involving social evaluations, allowing comparison of neural activations during self-evaluations, friend-evaluations, and perspective-taking self-evaluations. Although the two groups were not different in their wholebrain activations, anxiety and body shape concerns were correlated with neural activity in a priori regions of interest. A cluster in medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate correlated with the body shape questionnaire; subjects with more body shape concerns used this area less during self than friend evaluations. A cluster in medial prefrontal cortex and the cingulate also correlated with anxiety such that more anxiety was associated with engagement when disagreeing rather than agreeing with social terms during self-evaluations. This data suggests that differences in the utilization of frontal brain regions during social evaluations may contribute to both anxiety and body shape concerns in adolescents with AN. Clinical follow-up was obtained, allowing exploration of whether brain function early in course of disease relates to illness trajectory. The adolescents successful in recovery used the posterior cingulate and precuneus more for friend than self evaluations than the adolescents that remained ill, suggesting that neural differences related to social evaluations may provide clinical predictive value. Utilization of both MPFC and the precuneus during social and self evaluations may be a key biological component for achieving sustained weight-recovery in adolescents with AN.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

The cause of this distortion is unclear and disturbances in body perception could be involved. Body perception comprises estimating shape and location of one's body and requires integrating multisensory signals. We investigated if and how body location perception is changed and tested 23 AN patients and 23 healthy controls (HC) in a Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) reaching paradigm. We presented two types of multisensory conﬂicts (visual-proprioceptive hand location; visual-tactile touch synchrony) and tested if the impact of visual-proprioceptive and visual-tactile signals on hand location perception differs between AN and HC groups. We found signiﬁcant group differences in shifts of reaching trajectories, indicating that the inﬂuence of proprioceptive signals on hand location estimates is reduced in AN. Hand location estimates were relatively more biased towards external visual information, and shorter illness durations predicted a larger visual bias. Although touch synchrony also signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced hand location estimates, this effect did not differ between groups. Our ﬁndings provide compelling evidence that multisensory body location perception - speciﬁcally the processing of visual-proprioceptive signals – is changed in AN.},

Levels of sensitivity to sensation and attempts to avoid sensory experience were significantly higher in both clinical groups relative to healthy controls. Sensory sensitivity was associated with body image disturbance (r(56) = .51, p {\textless} .0001), indicating that body image disturbance increased with increased global sensitivity to sensation. Sensory sensitivity was also negatively and significantly correlated with lowest BMI (r2 = −.32, p {\textless} .001), but not current BMI (r2 = .03, p = .18), and to the temperament feature of harm avoidance in both clinical groups. We discuss how intervention strategies that address sensitization and habituation to somatic experience via conditioning exercises may provide a new manner in which to address body image disturbance in AN.},

This study aimed at exploring attitudinal and perceptual components of BID using a novel virtual reality (VR)-based paradigm. A community sample of women (N = 27) recreated in VR their perceived body in both an allocentric (thirdperson view) and egocentric (ﬁrst-person view) perspective. Speciﬁcally, women were able to choose between a wide range of three-dimensional bodies spanning body mass index 12.5–42.5 kg/m2. Attitudinal indexes of BID (body dissatisfaction, body uneasiness, and body image avoidance) were assessed through questionnaires. Attitudinal components predicted the perceptual BID only in the allocentric perspective. Speciﬁcally, overestimation was predicted by body image avoidance, while underestimation was predicted by body uneasiness. Furthermore, a common predictor of underestimation and overestimation was body dissatisfaction. In line with the allocentric lock hypothesis, the current results seem to conﬁrm the presence of two different mechanisms underlying BID: one related to real-time perception-driven inputs (egocentric frame) and one related to abstract knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes related to a person’s body (allocentric frame). These ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms underlying BID and provide additional evidence about the suitability of using VR for exploring and assessing body image-related components and disturbances.},

For example, perceived tactile distance is dependent on both the body part being touched and the stimulus orientation, a phenomenon called Weber’s illusion. These ﬁndings suggest the presence of size and shape distortions, respectively. However, whereas each morphological feature is typically measured in isolation, a complete morphological characterization requires the concurrent measurement of both size and shape. We did so in three experiments, manipulating both the stimulated body parts (hand; forearm) and stimulus orientation while requiring participants to make tactile distance judgments. We found that the forearm was signiﬁcantly more distorted than the hand lengthwise but not widthwise. Effects of stimulus orientation are thought to reﬂect receptive ﬁeld anisotropies in primary somatosensory cortex. The results of the present study therefore suggest that mental body representations retain homuncular shape distortions that characterize early stages of somatosensory processing.},

	abstract = {Background Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) have a persistent distorted experience of the size of their body. Previously we found that the Rubber Hand Illusion improves hand size estimation in this group. Here we investigated whether a Full Body Illusion (FBI) affects body size estimation of body parts more emotionally salient than the hand. In the FBI, analogue to the RHI, participants experience ownership over an entire virtual body in VR after synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation of the actual and virtual body.
Methods and Results We asked participants to estimate their body size (shoulders, abdomen, hips) before the FBI was induced, directly after induction and at {\textasciitilde}2 hour 45 minutes follow-up. The results showed that AN patients (N = 30) decrease the overestimation of their shoulders, abdomen and hips directly after the FBI was induced. This effect was strongest for estimates of circumference, and also observed in the asynchronous control condition of the illusion. Moreover, at follow-up, the improvements in body size estimation could still be observed in the AN group. Notably, the HC group (N = 29) also showed changes in body size estimation after the FBI, but the effect showed a different pattern than that of the AN group.
Conclusion The results lead us to conclude that the disturbed experience of body size in AN is flexible and can be changed, even for highly emotional body parts. As such this study offers novel starting points from which new interventions for body image disturbance in AN can be developed.},

The aims analysed in 77 dancers were: risk for ED; relationship between eating attitudes and psychological variables; dieting and self-weighing, and body image distortion.
Method: Weight- and body image-related variables, dieting, self-reported physical fitness, specific ED-related variables and other psychological variables were assessed. The robust Huber’s model was applied in order to test the influence of the variables analysed on the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40) scores. In case of categorical variables, the Chi-square (χ2-test) or the Fisher’s exact test were applied.
Results: Higher risk of ED was not obtained. Despite the relationship between EAT-40 and BMI, body appreciation and drive for thinness, scores on EAT-40 and BMI do not suggest higher risk in dancers. Dancers had a similar weight perception than other populations and body dissatisfaction seems not to be worse than the reported in other types of participants.
Conclusions: Despite some limitations, our study adds some data in this field of study bearing in mind the use of a cluster of variables previously not taken into account as a whole.},

	abstract = {Appearance-related attention biases are thought to contribute to body image disturbances. We investigated how preoccupation with body image is associated with attention biases to body size, focusing on the role of social comparison processes and automaticity. Thirty-six women varying on self-reported preoccupation compared their actual body size to size-modiﬁed images of either themselves or a ﬁgure-matched peer. Ampliﬁcation of earlier (N170, P2) and later (P3, LPP) ERP components recorded under low vs. high concurrent working memory load were analyzed. Women with high preoccupation exhibited an earlier bias to larger bodies of both self and peer. During later processing stages, they exhibited a stronger bias to enlarged as well as reduced self-images and a lack of sensitivity to size-modiﬁcations of the peer-image. Working memory load did not aﬀect these biases systematically. Current ﬁndings suggest that preoccupation with body image involves an earlier attention bias to weight increase cues and later over-engagement with own ﬁgure.},

Yet, body image perception is challenging to assess, given its subjective nature and variety of manifestations. The currently available methods have several limitations including restricted ability to assess perceptions of specific body areas. To address these limitations, we created Somatomap, a mobile tool that enables individuals to visually represent their perception of body-part sizes and shapes as well as areas of body concerns and record the emotional valence of concerns.},

	abstract = {Purpose  The allocentric lock theory (ALT) suggests that people with eating disorders have difficulties in multisensory integration in two reference frames—egocentric and allocentric, whereby the egocentric, but not allocentric, is impaired. This leads to a distorted body image that contributes to the development and maintenance of the disorder. The current study aimed to explore a facet of the ALT, namely, the visuo-spatial aspect, and its relation to cognitive flexibility in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN).
Methods  Fifty-five participants took part in the study: 20 AN patients and 35 controls, matched by age and education. The object perspective taking test (OPTT) and the mental rotation test (MRT), tapping egocentric and allocentric representations, respectively, and a set-shifting task were administered. The brief symptom inventory was used to measure overall levels of distress.
Results  AN patients showed higher level of distress. They performed poorer on the OPTT and set-shifting task but not on the MRT. The OPTT and MRT were correlated for controls but not for AN patients, while the set-shifting task and body mass index were associated with the OPTT but not with the MRT for the AN patients.
Conclusions  The findings support the ALT by demonstrating impaired visual egocentric representations and intact allocentric visual functions in AN patients, with cognitive flexibility associated only with the egocentric frame. Therefore, egocentric frame impairment in AN patients may be influenced by visual perception and cognitive flexibility deficiency.},

	abstract = {Body image disturbance has been highlighted as a common characteristic within the development and maintenance of clinical eating disorders (EDs), represented by alterations in an individual’s bodily experience. However, whilst the perceptual stability of the sense of body ownership has been investigated in ED patients, the stability of the sense of body agency in those with ED is yet to be examined. Therefore, body ownership and body agency were investigated using the moving rubber hand illusion, alongside measures of explicit and implicit body satisfaction. Furthermore, with evidence demonstrating a direct link between perceptual and cognitive-affective components of body image in the healthy population, the relationship between measures of body perception and body satisfaction was investigated. Results showed that both ED and healthy individuals displayed a similar subjective experience of illusory ownership and agency towards the fake hand, following voluntary movement. However, whilst both groups initially overestimated their own hand width prior to the illusion, the ED group displayed a significant reduction in hand size estimation following the illusion, which was not matched to the same degree in healthy individuals. In addition, ED individuals displayed a significantly lower body satisfaction compared with healthy females, on both an explicit and implicit level. Such implicit outcomes were shown to be driven specifically by a weaker association between the self and attractiveness. Finally, a significant relationship was observed between specific perceptual measures and implicit body satisfaction, which highlights the important link between perceptual and cognitive-affective components of one’s body image. Together, such findings provide a useful foundation for further research to study the conditions in which these two components relate with regard to body image and its disturbance, particularly in relation to the prognosis and treatment of EDs.},

	abstract = {Our ability to read other people's non-verbal signals gets refined throughout childhood and adolescence. How this is paralleled by brain development has been investigated mainly with regards to face perception, showing a protracted functional development of the face-selective visual cortical areas. In view of the importance of whole-body expressions in interpersonal communication it is important to understand the development of brain areas sensitive to these social signals. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activity in a group of 24 children (age 6-11) and 26 adults while they passively watched short videos of body or object movements. We observed activity in similar regions in both groups; namely the extra-striate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), amygdala and premotor regions. Adults showed additional activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Within the main body-selective regions (EBA, FBA and pSTS), the strength and spatial extent of fMRI signal change was larger in adults than in children. Multivariate Bayesian (MVB) analysis showed that the spatial pattern of neural representation within those regions did not change over age. Our results indicate, for the first time, that body perception, like face perception, is still maturing through the second decade of life.},

	abstract = {Our bodies are the most intimately familiar objects we encounter in our perceptual environment. Virtual reality provides a unique method to allow us to experience having a very different body from our own, thereby providing a valuable method to explore the plasticity of body representation. In this paper, we show that women can experience ownership over a whole virtual body that is considerably smaller or larger than their physical body. In order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying body ownership, we use an embodiment questionnaire, and introduce two new behavioral response measures: an affordance estimation task (indirect measure of body size) and a body size estimation task (direct measure of body size). Interestingly, after viewing the virtual body from first person perspective, both the affordance and the body size estimation tasks indicate a change in the perception of the size of the participant’s experienced body. The change is biased by the size of the virtual body (overweight or underweight). Another novel aspect of our study is that we distinguish between the physical, experienced and virtual bodies, by asking participants to provide affordance and body size estimations for each of the three bodies separately. This methodological point is important for virtual reality experiments investigating body ownership of a virtual body, because it offers a better understanding of which cues (e.g. visual, proprioceptive, memory, or a combination thereof) influence body perception, and whether the impact of these cues can vary between different setups.},

Perception does not result from a simple flow of sensory information from periphery to cortex (“bottom-up” processing), but involves the selection of inputs most likely to be relevant in light of an individual’s experience and expectations (“top-down” processing). Most investigations of body size distortion in AN have used procedures likely to engage top-down processing, raising the possibility that attitudinal disturbances may play a role. To our knowledge, there have been no studies that assess the presence, in AN, of neurocognitive deficits associated with neurologically based disturbances in body schema.

We tested 20 inpatients with AN on measures of proprioception, finger identification, right/left orientation, general cognition and eating disorders symptomatology, both before and after treatment. Matched normal controls were tested on the same measures over the same time intervals. Significant differences between the two groups occurred only prior to treatment, and only on those measures which involved executive, in addition to more body-schema-specific functions.

To date there has been no satisfactory measure of such concerns. A self-report instrument, the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) has therefore been developed. The items that constitute this measure were derived by conducting semistructured interviews with various groups of women including patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The BSQ has been administered to three samples of young women in the community as well as to a group of patients with bulimia nervosa. The concurrent and discriminant validity of the measure have been shown to be good. The BSQ provides a means of investigating the role of concerns about body shape in the development, maintenance, and treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.},

The 19-item questionnaire dealt with avoidance of situations that provoke concern about physical appearance, such as avoidance of tight-fitting clothes, social outings, and physical intimacy. The body image avoidance questionnaire had adequate internal consistency and test–retest reliability. The measure correlated highly with negative attitudes about weight and shape and with perceptual distortion of size. It distinguished women with bulimia nervosa from controls, was sensitive to change following treatment for severe body-image disturbance, and agreed with external raters. Norms for the measure and the factor structure are also provided. Although body-image disturbance is traditionally viewed as perceptual distortion of body size and negative attitudes about weight and shape, it is recommended that a multidimensional assessment also include attention to behavioral tendencies.

Thus we see the parallels between life crises and challenges at different times of life (such as adolescence and old age).

The concepts of body image and body schema have a firm tradition in each of these disciplines and make up the conceptual anchors of this volume.Challenged by neuropathological phenomena, neuroscience has dealt with body image and body schema since the beginning of the twentieth century. Halfway through the twentieth century, phenomenology was inspired by child development and elaborated a specifically phenomenological account of body image and schema. Starting from the mirror stage, this source of inspiration is shared with psychoanalysis which develops the concept of body image in interaction with the clinic of the singular subject. In this volume, the creative encounter of these three perspectives on the body opens up present-day paths for conceptualisation, research and (clinical) practice. (Series B)},

	abstract = {Consciousness and Mind presents David Rosenthal's influential work on the nature of consciousness. Central to that work is Rosenthal's higher-order-thought theory of consciousness, according to which a sensation, thought, or other mental state is conscious if one has a higher-order thought (HOT) that one is in that state. The first four essays develop various aspects of that theory. The next three essays present Rosenthal's homomorphism theory of mental qualities and qualitative consciousness, and show how that theory fits with and helps sustain the HOT theory. A crucial feature of homomorphism theory is that it individuates and taxonomizes mental qualities independently of the way we're conscious of them, and indeed independently of our being conscious of them at all. So the theory accommodates the qualitative character not only of conscious sensations and perceptions, but also of those which fall outside our stream of consciousness. Rosenthal argues that, because this account of mental qualities makes no appeal to consciousness, it enables us to dispel such traditional quandaries as the alleged conceivability of undetectable quality inversion, and to disarm various apparent obstacles to explaining qualitative consciousness and understanding its nature. Six further essays build on the HOT theory to explain various important features of consciousness, among them the complex connections that hold in humans between consciousness and speech, the self-interpretative aspect of consciousness, and the compelling sense we have that consciousness is unified. Two of the essays, one an extended treatment of homomorphism theory, appear here for the first time. There is also a substantive introduction, which draws out the connections between the essays and highlights their implications.},

Lycan not only uses the numerous arguments against materialism, and functionalist theories of mind in particular, to gain a more detailed positive view of the structure of the mind, he also targets the set of really hard problems at the center of the theory of consciousness: subjectivity, qualia, and the felt aspect of experience. The key to his own enlarged and fairly argued position, which he calls the "hegemony of representation, " is that there is no more to mind or consciousness than can be accounted for in terms of intentionality, functional organization, and in particular, second-order representation of one's own mental states.},

How can the technicolour phenomenology of our inner lives be created out of the complex neural activities of our brains? Many have despaired of finding answers to these questions; and many have claimed that human consciousness is inherently mysterious. Peter Carruthers argues, on the contrary, that the subjective feel of our experience is fully explicable in naturalistic (scientifically acceptable) terms. Drawing on a variety of interdisciplinary resources, he develops and defends a novel account in terms of higher-order thought. He shows that this can explain away some of the more extravagant claims made about phenomenal consciousness, while substantively explaining the key subjectivity of our experience. Written with characteristic clarity and directness, and surveying a wide range of extant theories, this book is essential reading for all those within philosophy and psychology interested in the problem of consciousness.},

Jackendoff first describes and contrasts the "phenomenological mind""—the mind as the locus of consciousness—and the "computational mind""—the mind as information processor. The author argues that to the degree that the phenomenological mind can be explained, it should be explained in terms of the computational mind. After examining a number of specific theories of consciousness, he arrives at an "intermediate-level theory.""  In order to develop the intermediate level theory, the book explores the nature of the mental representations that come into play in the linguistic, visual, and musical faculties of the mind. . . . The discussion of nonlinguistic information structures extends the framework developed for the language faculty to the faculties of vision and music, exploring a significant connection between David Marr"s theory of visual representation and Jackendoff"s own theory of linguistic meaning, and making the case that musical cognition is as much a part of psychology as are language and vision.

José Luis Bermúdez, extending the insights of his groundbreaking 1998 book, The Paradox of Self-Consciousness, argues that full-fledged, linguistic self-consciousness is built on a rich foundation of primitive, nonconceptual self-consciousness, and that these more primitive forms of self-consciousness persist in ways that frame self-conscious thought. They extend throughout the animal kingdom, and some are present in newborn human infants. Bermúdez makes the case that these primitive forms of self-awareness can indeed be described as forms of self-consciousness, arguing that they share certain structural and epistemological features with full-fledged, linguistic self-consciousness. He offers accounts of certain important classes of states of nonconceptual content, including the self-specifying dimension of visual perception and the content of bodily awareness, considering how they represent the self. And he explores the general role of nonconceptual self-consciousness in our cognitive and affective lives, examining in several essays the relation between nonconceptual awareness of our bodies and what has been called our “sense of ownership” for our own bodies.},

Here in one volume the leading researchers in this area address the central topics that define the intersection between phenomenological studies and the cognitive sciences. They address questions about methodology, the analysis of perception, memory, imagination, attention, emotion, intersubjectivity, the role of the body and language, and they explore a variety of pathologies that throw light on our everyday experiences. The authors draw on the classical works of phenomenologists such as Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Gurwitsch, and Sartre, but they also push the traditional lines of phenomenology to new boundaries, mapping out new terrain in connection with the empirical science of the mind and body. These essays are revelatory for both phenomenologists who want to understand what cognitive science can contribute to an understanding of experience, and for scientists who want to understand how they can use phenomenology in their empirical studies.},

For each participant (20 anorexics, 20 healthy controls) we built personalized avatars that reproduced their own body size, shape, and verisimilar increases and losses of their original weight. Body overestimation and dissatisfaction were measured by asking participants to choose the avatar that best resembled their real and ideal body. Results show higher body dissatisfaction in AN, caused by the desire of a thinner body, and no body-size overestimation. Interpersonal multisensory stimulation (IMS) was then applied on the avatar reproducing participant’s perceived body, and on the two avatars which reproduced increases and losses of 15\% of it, all presented with a ﬁrst-person perspective (1PP). Embodiment was stronger after synchronous IMS in both groups, but did not reduce BID in participants with AN. Interestingly, anorexics reported more negative emotions after embodying the fattest avatar, which scaled with symptoms severity. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that the cognitive-emotional, more than the perceptual component of BID is severely altered in AN and that perspective (1PP vs. 3PP) from which a body is evaluated may play a crucial role. Future research and clinical trials might take advantage of virtual reality to reduce the emotional distress related to body dissatisfaction.},

	abstract = {Background: Body change illusions have been of great interest in recent years for the understanding of how the brain represents the body. Appropriate multisensory stimulation can induce an illusion of ownership over a rubber or virtual arm, simple types of out-of-the-body experiences, and even ownership with respect to an alternate whole body. Here we use immersive virtual reality to investigate whether the illusion of a dramatic increase in belly size can be induced in males through (a) first person perspective position (b) synchronous visual-motor correlation between real and virtual arm movements, and (c) self-induced synchronous visual-tactile stimulation in the stomach area.
Methodology: Twenty two participants entered into a virtual reality (VR) delivered through a stereo head-tracked wide field-of-view head-mounted display. They saw from a first person perspective a virtual body substituting their own that had an inflated belly. For four minutes they repeatedly prodded their real belly with a rod that had a virtual counterpart that they saw in the VR. There was a synchronous condition where their prodding movements were synchronous with what they felt and saw and an asynchronous condition where this was not the case. The experiment was repeated twice for each participant in counter-balanced order. Responses were measured by questionnaire, and also a comparison of before and after self-estimates of belly size produced by direct visual manipulation of the virtual body seen from the first person perspective.
Conclusions: The results show that first person perspective of a virtual body that substitutes for the own body in virtual reality, together with synchronous multisensory stimulation can temporarily produce changes in body representation towards the larger belly size. This was demonstrated by (a) questionnaire results, (b) the difference between the selfestimated belly size, judged from a first person perspective, after and before the experimental manipulation, and (c) significant positive correlations between these two measures. We discuss this result in the general context of body ownership illusions, and suggest applications including treatment for body size distortion illnesses.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-517837-1},
	abstract = {The human body has long inspired artists, philosophers, musicians, and writers. Researchers in the psychological sciences, however, have only relatively recently begun to acknowledge the role the body plays in perception. With the general notion of cognition recently broadening to include its embodied nature, researchers' accounts of perception have increasingly come to include the body's special status as a window on the world and to accommodate the specific perceptual requirements for identifying, interpreting, and interacting with other bodies. This volume presents a comprehensive overview of the rapid progress that has been made in understanding the human body and its relationship to perception. It will help to unify the relevant research from several independent areas of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience and facilitate the development of an integrated framework for the study of human-body perception. Its sections cover the four major lines of research that have contributed and will continue to contribute to this new framework: body and multimodal perception, body representation, perception of biological motion, and intention and action in body perception. Each chapter provides a state-of-the-art account of exciting theoretical developments and empirical advances, and section introductions integrate the chapters and establish each section's place in the broader context of human-body-perception research. This volume will be an invaluable guide for student and professional researchers in visual perception, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience.},

Sur la base de ce concept, et en s'appuyant à chaque instant sur l'expérience analytique, Françoise Dolto suit l'élaboration de l'image du corps, phase après phase, en montrant que, chaque fois, le pas est franchi par une castration.

	abstract = {This book presents an argument that perception is something we do, not something that happens to us: not a process in the brain, but a skillful bodily activity. Perception is not something that happens to us, or in us, writes Alva Noe. It is something we do. In Action in Perception, Noe argues that perception and perceptual consciousness depend on capacities for action and thought - that perception is a kind of thoughtful activity. Touch, not vision, should be our model for perception. Perception is not a process in the brain, but a kind of skilful activity of the body as a whole. We enact our perceptual experience. To perceive, according to this enactive approach to perception, is not merely to have sensations; it is to have sensations that we understand. In Action in Perception, Noe investigates the forms this understanding can take. He begins by arguing, on both phenomenological and empirical grounds, that the content of perception is not like the content of a picture; the world is not given to consciousness all at once but is gained gradually by active inquiry and exploration. possession and exercise of practical bodily knowledge, and examines, among other topics, the problems posed by spatial content and the experience of colour. He considers the perspectival aspect of the representational content of experience and assesses the place of thought and understanding in experience. Finally, he explores the implications of the enactive approach for our understanding of the neuroscience of perception.},

In the case of the first group, it involves guiding doctoral students in their conception and design of a qualitative methodology that is properly phenomenological. In the case of the second, it is more concerned with explaining the relevance of phenomenology to an audience of experimental scientists via conference presentations or published papers. In both cases, however, the challenge is to make clear to the relevant audience what phenomenology is and how it can relate to what they are doing.},

	abstract = {Context: The integration of sensorimotor signals and prior beliefs contribute to our sense of body. An influential framework in the study of the bodily self is Gallagher’s distinction between body image and body schema, which are roughly comparable to the perceived body and the lived body, respectively. Through systematic manipulations of sensorimotor signals, it is possible to induce the illusion of agency or ownership over foreign limbs or full bodies. Yet, there is diverging empirical evidence regarding the coherence of sensorimotor signals necessary to elicit such illusions. Problem: The large amount of empirical evidence and its relation to the concepts of body image and schema is not well understood and requires more fine-graded distinctions of various aspects of sensorimotor coherences. Method: We systematically discuss literature on sensorimotor coherence during bodily illusions and argue for the importance of distinguishing between head- and limb-related coherences. To support this discussion, we present new experimental findings where participants experienced a first-person perspective (1PP) full-body illusion over another human through the manipulation of hand-related visuotactile or visuomotor coherence. Results: Participants showed no significant reduction in ownership after asynchronous visuotactile, but after asynchronous visuomotor stimulation. Based on these results and the literature, we propose that head-related temporal sensorimotor coherences are necessary to integrate limb-related incoherent signals during full-body illusions. Furthermore, we speculate that during full-body illusions, head-related coherences are a binding factor between the body image and the body schema; that is, only through the coherent manipulation of the visual field over a 1PP resulting from an immersive image (body image) is our body schema manipulated. Implications: While yet to be experimentally tested, distinguishing headand limb-related sensorimotor integration and their influences on body image and body schema could refine the study of the bodily self. Constructivist content: The plasticity of the bodily self - as shown in bodily illusions - reflects the dynamism of the subject as observer and its binding to its environment.},

We use tactile input to localize and experience the various qualities of touch, and proprioceptive information to determine the position of different parts of the body with respect to each other, which provides fundamental information for action. Further, tactile exploration of the characteristics of external objects can result in conscious perceptual experience and stimulus or object recognition. Neuroanatomical studies suggest parallel processing as well as serial processing within the cerebral somatosensory system that reﬂect these separate functions, with one processing stream terminating in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and the other terminating in the insula. We suggest that, analogously to the organisation of the visual system, somatosensory processing for the guidance of action can be dissociated from the processing that leads to perception and memory. In addition, we ﬁnd a second division between tactile information processing about external targets in service of object recognition and tactile information processing related to the body itself. We suggest the posterior parietal cortex subserves both perception and action, whereas the insula principally subserves perceptual recognition and learning.},

However, the treatment program is often hampered by patients’ reluctance to acknowledge the diagnosis because of erroneous lay representations. Recent advances in cognitive science offer a new understanding of the pathophysiology of functional somatic disorders, making this diagnosis more acceptable for patients and caregivers. Simply explained with practical examples, the Bayesian model in particular provides some insights into the underlying cognitive mechanisms of functional somatic syndromes and their treatments. Advantages of this approach are twofold: it is consistent with current scientiﬁc knowledge and it can facilitate the physician-patient relationship.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of the size of our own body parts is essential for accurately moving in space and efficiently interact with objects. A distorted perceptual representation of the body size often represents a core diagnostic criterion for some psychopathological conditions. The metric representation of the body was shown to depend on somatosensory afferences: local deafferentation indeed causes a perceptual distortion of the size of the anesthetized body part. A specular effect can be induced by altering the cortical map of body parts in the primary somatosensory cortex. Indeed, the present study demonstrates, in healthy adult participants, that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to the somatosensory cortical map of the hand in both hemispheres causes a perceptual distortion (i.e., an overestimation) of the size of the participants' own hand (Experiments 1–3), which does not involve other body parts (i.e., the foot, Experiment 2). Instead, the stimulation of the inferior parietal lobule of both hemispheres does not affect the perception of the own body size (Experiment 4). These results highlight the role of the primary somatosensory cortex in the building up and updating of the metric of body parts: somatosensory cortical activity not only shapes our somatosensation, it also affects how we perceive the dimension of our body.},

Here, I propose that E is embodied if some properties of E are processed in the same way as the properties of one’s body. However, one must distinguish among different types of embodiment, and only self-speciﬁc embodiment can lead to feelings of ownership. I address issues such as the functional role and the dynamics of embodiment, degrees and measures of ownership, and shared body representations between self and others. I then analyse the interaction between ownership and disownership. On the one hand, I show that there is no evidence that in the Rubber Hand Illusion, the rubber hand replaces the biological hand. On the other hand, I argue that the sense of disownership experienced by patients towards their body part cannot be reduced to the mere lack of ownership.},

Interactions between proprioception and touch provide a powerful way to investigate the implicit body representation underlying touch. Here, we demonstrate that an intrinsic primary quality of a tactile object, for example its size, is directly affected by the perceived size of the body part touching it. We elicited proprioceptive illusions that the left index finger was either elongating or shrinking by vibrating the biceps or triceps tendon of the right arm while subjects grasped the tip of their left index finger. Subjects estimated the distance between two simultaneous tactile contacts on the left finger during tendon vibration. We found that tactile distances feel bigger when the touched body part feels elongated. Control tests showed that the modulation of touch was linked to the perceived index-finger size induced by tendon vibration. Vibrations that did not produce proprioceptive illusion had no effect on touch. Our results show that the perception of tactile objects is referenced to an implicit body representation and that proprioception contributes to this body representation. We also provide, for the first time, a quantitative, implicit measure of distortions of body size.},

Or do certain types of representation depend so closely upon the body that their involvement in a cognitive task implicates the body itself? In the introduction of this special issue we explore lines of tension and complement that might hold between the notions of embodiment and body representations, which remain too often neglected or obscure. To do so, we distinguish two conceptions of embodiment that either put weight on the explanatory role of the body itself or body representations. We further analyse how and to what extent body representations can be said to be embodied. Finally, we give an overview of the full volume articulated around foundational issues (How should we define the notion of embodiment? To what extent and in what sense is embodiment compatible with representationalism? To what extent and in what sense are sensorimotor approaches similar to behaviourism?) and their applications in several cognitive domains (perception, concepts, selfhood, social cognition).},

	abstract = {Prominent theories highlight the importance of bodily perception for self-consciousness, but it is currently not known whether bodily perception is based on interoceptive or exteroceptive signals or on integrated signals from these anatomically distinct systems. In the research reported here, we combined both types of signals by surreptitiously providing participants with visual exteroceptive information about their heartbeat: A real-time video image of a periodically illuminated silhouette outlined participants’ (projected, “virtual”) bodies and flashed in synchrony with their heartbeats. We investigated whether these “cardio-visual” signals could modulate bodily self-consciousness and tactile perception. We report two main findings. First, synchronous cardio-visual signals increased self-identification with and self-location toward the virtual body, and second, they altered the perception of tactile stimuli applied to participants’ backs so that touch was mislocalized toward the virtual body. We argue that the integration of signals from the inside and the outside of the human body is a fundamental neurobiological process underlying self-consciousness.},

	abstract = {Self-consciousness has mostly been approached by philosophical enquiry and not by empirical neuroscientiﬁc study, leading to an overabundance of diverging theories and an absence of data-driven theories. Using robotic technology, we achieved speciﬁc bodily conﬂicts and induced predictable changes in a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness by altering where healthy subjects experienced themselves to be (self-location). Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) activity reﬂected experimental changes in self-location that also depended on the ﬁrst-person perspective due to visuo-tactile and visuo-vestibular conﬂicts. Moreover, in a large lesion analysis study of neurological patients with a welldeﬁned state of abnormal self-location, brain damage was also localized at TPJ, providing causal evidence that TPJ encodes self-location. Our ﬁndings reveal that multisensory integration at the TPJ reﬂects one of the most fundamental subjective feelings of humans: the feeling of being an entity localized at a position in space and perceiving the world from this position and perspective.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have reported that adaptation to extreme body types produces aftereffects on judgments of body normality and attractiveness, and also judgments of the size and shape of the viewer’s own body. This latter effect suggests that adaptation could constitute an experimental model of media influences on body image. Alternatively, adaptation could affect perception of test stimuli, which should produce the same aftereffects for judgments about participant’s own body or someone else’s body. Here, we investigated whether adaptation similarly affects judgments about one’s body and other bodies. We were interested in participants’ own body image judgments, i.e., we wanted to measure the mental representations to which the test stimuli were compared and not the perception of test stimuli per se. Participants were adapted to pictures of thin or fat bodies and then rated whether bodies were fatter or thinner than either: their own body, an average body (Experiment 1), or the body of another person (Experiments 2 and 3). By keeping the visual stimuli constant but changing the task/type of judgment, i.e., the internal criterion participants are asked to judge the bodies against, we investigated how adaptation affects different stored representations of bodies, specifically own body image vs. representations of others. After adaptation, a classic aftereffect was found, with judgments biased away from the adapting stimulus. Critically, aftereffects were nearly identical for judgments of one’s own body and for other people’s bodies. These results suggest that adaptation affects body representations in a generic way and may not be specific to the own body image.},

We investigated this issue in the context of the rubber hand illusion (RHI), an illusion of body image in which a prosthetic hand brushed synchronously, but not asynchronously, with one’s own hand is perceived as actually being one’s hand. We conducted a large-scale study of the RHI, and used psychometric analysis to reveal the structure of the subjective experience of the experience of embodiment (Longo et al., 2008, Cognition, 107, 978-998). Here, we use this dataset to investigate the relation between incorporation of a rubber hand into the body image and the perceived similarity between the participant’s hand and the rubber hand. Objective similarity (as measured by skin luminance, hand shape, and third-person similarity ratings) did not appear to influence participants’ experience of the RHI. Conversely, incorporation of the rubber hand into the body image did affect the similarity that participants perceived between their own hand and the rubber hand. Participants who had experienced the RHI perceived their hand and the rubber hand as significantly more similar than participants who had not experienced the illusion. That is, embodiment lead to perceived similarity, but perceived similarity did not lead to embodiment. Furthermore, similarity ratings following the illusion were selectively correlated with some components of embodiment, but not with others. These results suggest an important role of a mental body image in the perception of the relation between the self and others.},

It shows, with particular reference to Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception, how phenomenological insights into bodily awareness and its role in agency can be developed and illuminated by research into somatic proprioception and motor control. The essay presents a taxonomy of different types and levels of bodily awareness and presents a model of the spatiality of bodily awareness that explains some of the fundamental differences that Merleau-Ponty identiﬁed between our experience of our bodies and our experience of non-bodily objects. The key to these differences is that bodily locations are given on a non-Cartesian frame of reference. The ﬁnal section shows how this way of thinking about the phenomenology of bodily awareness has interesting and fruitful connections with current thinking about motor control.},

We show that the notion of a sense of presence can be interpreted in two ways, corresponding to the sense that we are acquainted with an object, and the sense that the object is real. In this essay, we focus on the sense of reality. Drawing on several case studies such as derealization disorder, Parkinson’s disease and virtual reality, we argue that the sense of reality is two-way independent from the spatial and sensory contents of experience. We suggest that the sense of reality is an affective experience akin to a metacognitive feeling. Finally, we present a potentially important implication of our account for the current debate between Intentionalism and Na¨ıve Realism. Since perception is ‘‘opaque’’ with respect to the reality of what is perceived, Intentionalism cannot refer to the sense of reality as what differentiates perception from sensory-like experiences such as imaginings. In contrast, Na¨ıve Realism has an independent explanation of the speciﬁcity of perception.},

	abstract = {Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge.},

This paper reviews the sensory systems involved in internal representations of the body—primarily the proprioceptive, motor, vestibular, and visual systems. Various neurological disorders are deﬁned by aberrations in bodily experience—including the perceptual ablation or disembodiment of body parts, ‘‘ﬁlling in’’ of amputated body parts, or reduplication of body parts. These perceptual aberrations are discussed and their implications for the central and peripheral systems involved in updating and retrieving internal representations of the body are highlighted. Bodily perception and egocentric frames of reference can be experimentally manipulated through visual capture (e.g., using rubber limbs), functional adaptation and embodiment of tools and prostheses, and changes in afferent sensory feedback (e.g., through stimulation of muscle spindles). These perceptual illusions are described, and discussed for their implications for the mechanisms underlying bodily perception.},

Here we discuss recent ﬁndings in both healthy volunteers and clinical populations that highlight the robust relationship that exists between a person’s sense of ownership over a body part, cortical processing of tactile input from that body part, and its physiological regulation. We propose that a network of multisensory and homeostatic brain areas may be responsible for maintaining a ‘body-matrix’. That is, a dynamic neural representation that not only extends beyond the body surface to integrate both somatotopic and peripersonal sensory data, but also integrates body-centred spatial sensory data. The existence of such a ‘body-matrix’ allows our brain to adapt to even profound anatomical and conﬁgurational changes to our body. It also plays an important role in maintaining homeostatic control over the body. Its alteration can be seen to have both deleterious and beneﬁcial effects in various clinical populations.},

	abstract = {Our experience of the body is not direct; rather, it is mediated by perceptual information, inﬂuenced by internal information, and recalibrated through stored implicit and explicit body representation (body memory). This paper presents an overview of the current investigations related to body memory by bringing together recent studies from neuropsychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary and cognitive psychology. To do so, in the paper, I explore the origin of representations of human body to elucidate their developmental process and, in particular, their relationship with more explicit concepts of self. First, it is suggested that our bodily experience is constructed from early development through the continuous integration of sensory and cultural data from six different representations of the body, i.e., the Sentient Body (Minimal Selfhood), the Spatial Body (Self Location), the Active Body (Agency), the Personal Body (Whole Body Ownership e Me); the Objectiﬁed Body (Objectiﬁed Self e Mine), and the Social Body (Body Satisfaction e Ideal Me). Then, it is suggested that these six representations can be combined in a coherent supramodal representation, i.e. the “body matrix”, through a predictive, multisensory processing activated by central, topedown, attentional processes. From an evolutionary perspective, the main goal of the body matrix is to allow the self to protect and extend its boundaries at both the homeostatic and psychological levels. From one perspective, the self extends its boundaries (peripersonal space) through the enactment and recognition of motor schemas. From another perspective, the body matrix, by deﬁning the boundaries of the body, also deﬁnes where the self is present, i.e., in the body that is processed by the body matrix as the most likely to be its one, and in the space surrounding it. In the paper I also introduce and discuss the concept of “embodied medicine”: the use of advanced technology for altering the body matrix with the goal of improving our health and well-being.},

	abstract = {Evidence from psychology and neuroscience indicates that our spatial experience, including the bodily one, involves the integration of different sensory inputs within two different reference frames egocentric (body as reference of ﬁrst-person experience) and allocentric (body as object in the physical world). Even if functional relations between these two frames are usually limited, they inﬂuence each other during the interaction between long- and short-term memory processes in spatial cognition. If, for some reasons, this process is impaired, the egocentric sensory inputs are no more able to update the contents of the allocentric representation of the body: the subject is locked to it. In the presented perspective, subjects with eating disorders are locked to an allocentric representation of their body, stored in long-term memory (allocentric lock). A signiﬁcant role in the locking may be played by the medial temporal lobe, and in particular by the connection between the hippocampal complex and amygdala. The differences between exogenous and endogenous causes of the lock may also explain the difference between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.},

	abstract = {Progress in medical science and technology drastically improved physicians’ ability to interact with patient’s physical body. Nevertheless, medicine still addresses the human body from a Hippocratic point of view, considering the organism and its processes just as a matter of mechanics and ﬂuids. However, the interaction between the cognitive neuroscience of bodily self-consciousness (BSC), fundamentally rooted in the integration of multisensory bodily inputs, with virtual reality (VR), haptic technologies and robotics is giving a new meaning to the classic Juvenal’s latin dictum “Mens sana in corpore sano” (a healthy mind in a healthy body). This vision provides the basis for a new research ﬁeld, “Embodied Medicine”: the use of advanced technologies for altering the experience of being in a body with the goal of improving health and wellbeing. Up to now, most of the research efforts in the ﬁeld have been focused upon how external bodily information is processed and integrated. Despite the important results, we believe that existing bodily illusions still need to be improved to enhance their capability to effectively correct pathological dysfunctions. First, they do not follow the suggestions provided by the free-energy and predictive coding approaches. More, they lacked to consider a peculiar feature of the human body, the multisensory integration of internal inputs (interoceptive, proprioceptive and vestibular) that constitute our inner body dimension. So, a future challenge is the integration of simulation/stimulation technologies also able to measure and modulate this internal/inner experience of the body. Finally, we also proposed the concept of “Sonoception” as an extension of this approach. The core idea is to exploit recent technological advances in the acoustic ﬁeld to use sound and vibrations to modify the internal/inner body experience.},

Findings revealed that after participants embodied a virtual body with a skinny belly (independently of the type of visuo-tactile stimulation), there was an update of the stored representation of the body: participants reported a decrease in the ratio between estimated and actual body measures for most of the body parts considered. Based on the Allocentric Lock Theory, these ﬁndings provide ﬁrst evidence that VR body swapping is able to induce a change in the memory of the body. This knowledge may be potentially useful for patients suffering from eating and weight disorders.},

	abstract = {According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) eating problems are the clinical core of eating disorders (EDs). However, the importance of shape and weight overvaluation symptoms in these disorders underlines the critical role of the experience of the body in the etiology of EDs. This article suggests that the transdiagnostic centrality of these symptoms in individuals with EDs may reﬂect a deﬁcit in the processing and integration of multisensory bodily representations and signals. Multisensory body integration is a critical cognitive and perceptual process, allowing the individual to protect and extend her/his boundaries at both the homeostatic and psychological levels. To achieve this goal the brain integrates sensory data arriving from real-time multiple sensory modalities and internal bodily information with predictions made using the stored information about the body from conceptual, perceptual, and episodic memory. In this view the emotional, visual, tactile, proprioceptive and interoceptive deﬁcits reported by many authors in individuals with EDs may reﬂect a broader impairment in multisensory body integration that affects the individual’s abilities: (a) to identify the relevant interoceptive signals that predict potential pleasant (or aversive) consequences; and (b) to modify/correct the autobiographical allocentric (observer view) memories of body related events (self-objectiﬁed memories). Based on this view, the article also proposes a strategy, based on new technologies (i.e., virtual reality and brain/body stimulation), for using crossmodal associations to reactivate and correct the multisensory body integration processes.},

	abstract = {The recent distinction between sense of agency and sense of body-ownership has attracted considerable empirical and theoretical interest. The respective contributions of central motor signals and peripheral aﬀerent signals to these two varieties of body experience remain unknown. In the present review, we consider the methodological problems encountered in the empirical study of agency and body-ownership, and we then present a series of experiments that study the interplay between motor and sensory information. In particular, we focus on how multisensory signals interact with body representations to generate the sense of body-ownership, and how the sense of agency modulates the sense of body-ownership. Finally, we consider the respective roles of eﬀerent and aﬀerent signals for the experience of one’s own body and actions, in relation to self-recognition and the recognition of other people’s actions. We suggest that the coherent experience of the body depends on the integration of eﬀerent information with aﬀerent information in action contexts. Overall, whereas aﬀerent signals provide the distinctive content of one’s own body experience, eﬀerent signals seem to structure the experience of one’s own body in an integrative and coherent way.},

However, current theories of self-recognition are not embedded within global theories of cortical function and therefore fail to provide a compelling explanation of how the self is processed. We present a theoretical account of the neural and computational basis of selfrecognition that is embedded within the free-energy account of cortical function. In this account one’s body is processed in a Bayesian manner as the most likely to be “me”. Such probabilistic representation arises through the integration of information from hierarchically organised unimodal systems in higher-level multimodal areas. This information takes the form of bottom-up “surprise” signals from unimodal sensory systems that are explained away by top-down processes that minimise the level of surprise across the brain. We present evidence that this theoretical perspective may account for the findings of psychological and neuroimaging investigations into self-recognition and particularly evidence that representations of the self are malleable, rather than fixed as previous accounts of self-recognition might suggest.},

This distinction may be based on a process that monitors whether sensations, events and objects should be attributed to one’s body or not. We controlled whether an external object was represented as part of the body or not, by experimentally inducing a bodily illusion using correlated visual and tactile stimulation. We then studied the role of right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) in the processing of multisensory events that may or may not be attributed to one’s body. Disruption of rTPJ using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) made the distinction between what may or may not be part of one’s body on the basis of multisensory evidence more ambiguous, suggesting that the rTPJ is actively involved in maintaining a coherent sense of one’s body, distinct from external, non-corporeal, objects.},

	abstract = {One’s experiences of hunger, food, eating, and the body are not only subjective but intersubjective: They involve one’s relation to others. On the basis of this observation, what is proposed here is a conception of anorexia as bodily intersubjective: Anorexia would involve, via the manipulation of food and eating behavior, the transformation of the subject’s body, as a way of impacting her relations to others. The anorexic subject would instrumentalize her eating behavior and bodily shape to address others, thereby putting them in a position to respond to her meaningfully, by manifesting their sensitivity to her desire. Importantly, in this view, anorexia is not positioned on the intersubjective scene by opposition to the bodily and alimentary scene; rather, what is proposed is that anorexic sufferance is intersubjective insofar as it is bodily. After some clinical observations describing how anorexia is bodily intersubjective in a concrete way, an overview allows for consideration of whether this conception of anorexia conﬂicts with or is supported by the main approaches that are currently inﬂuential in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Objective. – The objective here is to conceive the relationship to alterity at stake in anorexia. If the subject who eats is confronted with what it is not and upon which it depends (food), then anorexia implies the refusal to surrender to such alterity. Likewise, the anorexic would not assume the alterity of the other subject for whom or against whom the act of eating is organized. It is the hypothesis that we defend here.
Method. – It is by relying on Levinas’ philosophy that anorexia is better understood as a problematic of alterity. Indeed, what Levinas reveals is that the other subject is not another ‘myself’ but an inassimilable ‘other’. Confronted with clinical observations, this conception demonstrates its relevance for understanding the anorexic as a subject for whom inassimilable alterity is unbearable.
Results. – Either the other is assimilated as the one the anorexic is not but wants to become; or the other is rejected as a radical alterity which the anorexic cannot assume as such. In both cases, it is to others that the anorexia is addressed; inviting and rejecting them. Discussion. – In the diversity of their manifestations, anorexics are animated by the same ﬁght against a subjection of their subjectivity to the alterity of the other.
Conclusion. – Engaged in such intersubjective problematic, the anorexic manifests an alimentary communication by stripping food from its nutritional matter in order to make of it an element of language; doing so, the anorexic materializes hunger in a body which is transformed to address it to others.},

We will answer this question positively by determining a form of experience where the body′s physicality is experienced in a non-reifying manner. We will consider a form of experience of oneself as bodily which is different from both “prenoetic embodiment” and “pre-reflective bodily consciousness” and rather corresponds to a form of reflective access to subjectivity at the bodily level. In particular, we argue that subjectivity is bodily expressed, thereby allowing the experience of the body′s subjectivity directly during perceptual experiences of the body. We use an interweaving of phenomenological explorations and ethnographical methods which allows validating this proposal by considering the experience of body experts (dancers).},

	abstract = {Our scientiﬁc activity is focused on the ﬁeld of action and representation of action from various adaptative situations during the life span, including pathology and extreme environment such as microgravity. The early action/perception matching, subserving the motor simulation network, is probably a major milestone for the building of action and representation of action during the course of ontogenesis. We have developed a functional approach of motor development based on a gradual mastering of coordination, adaptation and anticipation in postural control in the course of ontogenesis from babies to adolescents. This functional approach is recently associated with studies of brain structures involved in action and representation of action in children and adolescents with typical or atypical neurodevelopment. From our developmental studies, it was possible to put in light two turning points during motor development, such as 6/7 years of age and adolescence. The ﬁrst step for children consists in building a repertoire of postural strategies. The second step consists in learning to select postural strategy depending on the characteristics of the task and the environmental requirements. An appropriate selection means to anticipate the consequence of the movement in order to maintain balance control and efﬁciency of the task. Taking into account the complexity of the parameters to control and the late maturation of anticipation and representation of action, it is not surprising that the development of postural control continues up to late periods during childhood and adolescence.},

	abstract = {The network between the parietal cortex and premotor cortex has a pivotal role in sensory-motor control. Grasping-related neurons in the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) and the ventral premotor cortex (F5) showed complementary properties each other. The object information for grasping is sent from the parietal cortex to the premotor cortex for sensory-motor transformation, and the backward signal from the premotor cortex to parietal cortex can be considered an efference copy/corollary discharge that is used to predict sensory outcome during motor behavior. Mirror neurons that represent both own action and other’s action are involved in this system. This system also very well ﬁts with body schema that reﬂects online state of the body during motor execution. We speculate that the parieto-premotor network, which includes the mirror neuron system, is key for mapping one’s own body and the bodies of others. This means that the neuronal substrates that control one’s own action and the mirror neuron system are shared with the “who” system, which is related to the recognition of action contribution, i.e., sense of agency. Representation of own and other‘s body in the parieto-premotor network is key to link between sensory-motor control and higher-order cognitive functions.},

The default mode network consistently decreases its activity when compared with activity during these relaxed nontask states. The discovery of the default mode network reignited a longstanding interest in the signiﬁcance of the brain’s ongoing or intrinsic activity. Presently, studies of the brain’s intrinsic activity, popularly referred to as resting-state studies, have come to play a major role in studies of the human brain in health and disease. The brain’s default mode network plays a central role in this work.},

Four subscales are designed to assess perceptions within specific subdomains of the physical self, physical condition, sport competence, attractive body and physical strength. One hundred and sixty eight subjects (study I) responded to our 30 items inventory. A principal components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation confirmed factorial structure hypothesis. However, the deletion of 5 items increased the internal consistency of subdomains. Hierarchical organisation of self-perception of our 25 items experimental inventory tested with correlational and confirmatory analyses (LISREL) showed specific aspect for the attractive body's subscale. Study 2 proved the fidelity of this French experimental version of the PSPP.},

	abstract = {Resting heart rate variability (HRV), an index of parasympathetic cardioregulation and an individual trait marker related to mental and physical health, decreases with age. Previous studies have associated resting HRV with structural and functional properties of the brain – mainly in cortical midline and limbic structures. We hypothesized that aging affects the relationship between resting HRV and brain structure and function. In 388 healthy subjects of three age groups (140 younger: 26.0 Æ 4.2 years, 119 middle-aged: 46.3 Æ 6.2 years, 129 older: 66.9 Æ 4.7 years), gray matter volume (GMV, voxel-based morphometry) and resting state functional connectivity (eigenvector centrality mapping and exploratory seed-based functional connectivity) were related to resting HRV, measured as the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Conﬁrming previous ﬁndings, resting HRV decreased with age. For HRV-related GMV, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the age groups, nor similarities across all age groups. In whole-brain functional connectivity analyses, we found an agedependent association between resting HRV and eigenvector centrality in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), driven by the younger adults. Across all age groups, HRV was positively correlated with network centrality in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis using the vmPFC cluster revealed an HRV-related cortico-cerebellar network in younger but not in middle-aged or older adults. Our results indicate that the decrease of HRV with age is accompanied by changes in functional connectivity along the cortical midline. This extends our knowledge of brain-body interactions and their changes over the lifespan.},

	abstract = {We experience our body as a 3D, volumetric object in the world. Measures of our conscious body image, in contrast, have investigated the perception of body size along one or two dimensions at a time. There is, thus, a discrepancy between existing methods for measuring body image and our subjective experience of having 3D body. Here we assessed in a sample of healthy adults the perception of body size in terms of its 1D length and 3D volume. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups using different measuring units (other body part and non-body object). They estimated how many units would ﬁt in a perceived size of body segments and the whole body. The patterns of length and volume misperception across judged segments were determined as their perceived size proportional to their actual size. The pattern of volume misperception paints the representation of 3D body proportions resembling those of a somatosensory homunculus. The body parts with a smaller actual surface area relative to their volume were underestimated more. There was a tendency for body parts underestimated in volume to be overestimated in length. Perceived body proportions thus changed as a function of judgement type while showing a similarity in magnitude of the absolute estimation error, be it an underestimation of volume or overestimation of length. The main contribution of this study is assessing the body image as a 3D body representation, and thus extending beyond the conventional ‘allocentric’ focus to include the body on the inside. Our ﬁndings highlight the value of studying the perceptual distortions “at the baseline”, i.e., in healthy population, so as to advance the understanding of the nature of perceptual distortions in clinical conditions.},

In order to keep such visual-tactile spatial interactions effective, the brain updates the continuous postural changes, like those typically accompanying hand actions, through proprioception, thus maintaining the somatosensory and visual maps in spatial register [2, 3]. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) might be critical for such a spatial remapping [4]; nevertheless, a direct causal demonstration of its involvement is lacking. Here, we found that unattended touches to one hand enhanced visual sensitivity for phosphenes induced by occipital trancranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [5] when the touched hand was spatially coincident to the reported location of the phosphenes in external space. Notably, this spatially speciﬁc crossmodal facilitation was maintained after hand crossing, suggesting an efﬁcient visual-tactile remapping. Critically, after 1 Hz repetitive TMS interference [6] over the PPC, but not over the primary somatosensory cortex, phosphene detection was still enhanced by spatially coincident touches with uncrossed hands, but it was enhanced by spatially noncoincident touches after hand crossing. This is the ﬁrst causal evidence in humans that the PPC constantly updates the representation of the body in space in order to facilitate crossmodal interactions.},

	abstract = {"Il n'existe à ce jour aucun consensus quant à la définition et à l'usage scientifique du concept de représentation. Les étudiants et chercheurs du domaine ne disposent pas d'ouvrages spécifiques dressant un état des lieux précis du concept de représentation, concept pourtant fondateur et très employé dans le champ d'investigation des Sciences Cognitives (Psychologie, Sciences du Langage, Intelligence Artificielle, Neurosciences, Philosophie, Anthropologie--). Pour tenter de combler ce vide, cet ouvrage fait le point sur l'utilisation de la notion de représentation dans les différents champs d'étude de la cognition. Contrairement aux études qui ne la traite souvent qu'au niveau de description de la philosophie analytique, dans un vocabulaire technique parfois difficile d'accès, il propose des réflexions conduites à différents niveaux d'analyse, enrichies par des points de vue variés, afin de tenter de répondre aux interrogations restées en suspens. Afin de le rendre accessible au plus grand nombre, les auteurs ont privilégié une approche structurée, claire, simple mais réfléchie. Les étudiants y trouveront l'occasion d'acquérir les outils et les concepts principaux autour desquels s'articule le débat contemporain sur la notion de représentation en sciences cognitives. Il fournira au chercheur des outils qu'il pourra utiliser dans sa pratique quotidienne et qui l'inviteront à prendre position sur le plan philosophique. Il l'invitera également à mettre à jour les connaissances dont il dispose , et au coeur des réflexions qui nourrissent le débat actuel.

	abstract = {The rubber hand illusion is a perceptual illusion in which a model hand is experienced as part of one’s own body. In the present study we directly compared the classical illusion, based on visuotactile stimulation, with a rubber hand illusion based on active and passive movements. We examined the question of which combinations of sensory and motor cues are the most potent in inducing the illusion by subjective ratings and an objective measure (proprioceptive drift). In particular, we were interested in whether the combination of afferent and efferent signals in active movements results in the same illusion as in the purely passive modes. Our results show that the illusion is equally strong in all three cases. This demonstrates that different combinations of sensory input can lead to a very similar phenomenological experience and indicates that the illusion can be induced by any combination of multisensory information.},

	abstract = {Previous work has reported that it is not difﬁcult to give people the illusion of ownership over an artiﬁcial body, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying body perception and self consciousness. We present an experimental study that uses immersive virtual reality (IVR) focused on identifying the perceptual building blocks of this illusion. We systematically manipulated visuotactile and visual sensorimotor contingencies, visual perspective, and the appearance of the virtual body in order to assess their relative role and mutual interaction. Consistent results from subjective reports and physiological measures showed that a ﬁrst person perspective over a fake humanoid body is essential for eliciting a body ownership illusion. We found that the illusion of ownership can be generated when the virtual body has a realistic skin tone and spatially substitutes the real body seen from a ﬁrst person perspective. In this case there is no need for an additional contribution of congruent visuotactile or sensorimotor cues. Additionally, we found that the processing of incongruent perceptual cues can be modulated by the level of the illusion: when the illusion is strong, incongruent cues are not experienced as incorrect. Participants exposed to asynchronous visuotactile stimulation can experience the ownership illusion and perceive touch as originating from an object seen to contact the virtual body. Analogously, when the level of realism of the virtual body is not high enough and/or when there is no spatial overlap between the two bodies, then the contribution of congruent multisensory and/or sensorimotor cues is required for evoking the illusion. On the basis of these results and inspired by ﬁndings from neurophysiological recordings in the monkey, we propose a model that accounts for many of the results reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” (MPS) describes the basic, pre-reﬂective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of MPS (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reﬂective bodily processes. The free energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010) is a novel uniﬁed theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the FEP via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the FEP in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of MPS can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the FEP and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.},

In addition, it examined whether overall performance was related to age, gender and speciﬁc physical characteristics, such as height, weight and body mass index (BMI). Seventy-four female and 80 male children between the ages of 6 and 12 years participated in the study, as well as 20 adults, aged 20–22 years. The Sensory Organization Test (SOT), a component of computerized dynamic posturography, was used to assess overall balance as well as the use of speciﬁc sensory information in maintaining stability. Analyses of variance revealed signiﬁcant differences between equilibrium scores of 7- and 8-year-old and 11- and 12-year-old ( p {\textless} .01), with only the 12-year-old participants achieving scores comparable to those of the adult group. A repeated-measures analysis of variance comparing the use of different sensory information across age and gender groups revealed that while all groups demonstrated mature use of somatosensory information, children under 11 did not use visual information as effectively as adults, and only the 12-year-old group demonstrated adult-like use of vestibular information. Correlational analyses revealed a moderate correlation between composite balance scores and age, r(152) = .38, p {\textless} .001, but poor correlations between the composite equilibrium score and height, weight and BMI (r {\textless} .13, p {\textgreater} .15). Multiple regression analysis revealed that while physical characteristics accounted for approximately 20\% of the variability in the composite equilibrium score, age alone accounted for the largest single contribution to the variance (16\%). These results support recent ﬁndings suggesting that children do not demonstrate adult-like use of sensory information prior to age 12 years.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed (1) to identify the developmental status of balance and sensory functions in young adolescents as compared to adults and, (2) to explore the effect of Taekwondo (TKD) training on the development of balance and sensory systems in young adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional controlled trial. Methods: Sixty-six participants including 42 adolescents (21 TKD practitioners, 21 non-TKD practitioners) and 24 adults were tested. The sway velocity of centre of gravity was recorded during standing on the non-dominant leg on a Smart Equitest ® system. The somatosensory, vestibular and visual ratios were also measured with the machine. Results: Adult participants swayed slower than both TKD and non-TKD adolescent groups during single leg stance with eyes open (p = 0.007 and p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). The TKD adolescent group, in turn, swayed slower than the non-TKD adolescent group (p {\textless} 0.001). Adult participants had better visual ratio than both TKD and non-TKD adolescents (p = 0.001 and p {\textless} 0.001, respectively) while there was no difference between the TKD and nonTKD adolescents (p = 0.164). For the vestibular ratio, there was no signiﬁcant difference between adult participants and TKD adolescents (p = 0.432). Adolescents who did not practice TKD showed signiﬁcantly lower vestibular ratio than TKD adolescents and adults (p = 0.003 and p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). In addition, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the somatosensory ratio among the 3 participant groups (p = 0.711). Conclusions: Participation in TKD appears to speed up the development of postural control and vestibular function in adolescents. Clinicians might advocate TKD exercise as a therapeutic intervention for young people with balance or vestibular dysfunctions.},

Results: The mean stability percentages for children were signiﬁcantly lower than for young adults. Vestibular ratios were lower in children compared to young adults, whereas somesthesic ratios were similar for the two groups. Visual dependence was signiﬁcant higher in children.
Conclusions: Children unlike young adults had lower stability percentages when visual information was not available or was incorrect. Ratio synthesis pattern was different in the two groups. Our results on BQ partially conﬁrms previous results obtained in children assessed with Equitest CDP. This study also provides BQ normative data for these two age groups.},

	abstract = {Most of current knowledge about the mechanisms of multisensory integration of environmental stimuli by the human brain derives from neuroimaging experiments. However, neuroimaging studies do not always provide conclusive evidence about the causal role of a given area for multisensory interactions, since these techniques can mainly derive correlations between brain activations and behavior. Conversely, techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) represent a unique and powerful approach to inform models of causal relations between specific brain regions and individual cognitive and perceptual functions. Although NIBS has been widely used in cognitive neuroscience, its use in the study of multisensory processing in the human brain appears a quite novel field of research. In this paper, we review and discuss recent studies that have used two techniques of NIBS, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, for investigating the causal involvement of unisensory and heteromodal cortical areas in multisensory processing, the effects of multisensory cues on cortical excitability in unisensory areas, and the putative functional connections among different cortical areas subserving multisensory interactions. The emerging view is that NIBS is an essential tool available to neuroscientists seeking for causal relationships between a given area or network and multisensory processes.With its already large and fast increasing usage, future work using NIBS in isolation, as well as in conjunction with different neuroimaging techniques, could substantially improve our understanding of multisensory processing in the human brain.},

Four such interactions are described: the link between the body surface and the maps in primary somatosensory cortex, the contribution of somatosensory cortical information to mental body representations, the feedback pathway from such higher representations back to primary tactile processing in somatosensory cortex, and the modulation of tactile object perception by mental body representations.},

	abstract = {There is evidence that adolescence is a critical period in development, most likely involving important modifications of the body schema and of the sensorimotor representations. The present study addressed this issue, by investigating the differences between adolescents and adults regarding the integration of proprioceptive information at both perceptual and postural levels and the visual recognition of human movement. Proprioceptive integration was examined using muscle-tendon vibration that evoked either a postural response or an illusory sensation of movement. The ability to recognize human movement was investigated from a paradigm where the participants had to discern between human movements performed with and without gravity. The study produced three main findings. First, the adolescents had larger postural responses to tendon vibrations than the adults, with visual information enabling them to reduce this exaggerated postural reaction. Second, the adolescents had a greater illusory perception of movement compared with the adults. Third, the adolescents had the same perceptual ability as adults in the human movement perception task. In conclusion, we were able to highlight notable differences between adolescents and young adults, which confirms the late maturation of multisensory integration for postural control and the privileged visual contribution to postural control.},

	abstract = {Vision of the body is known to aVect somatosensory perception (e.g. proprioception or tactile discrimination). However, it is unknown whether visual information about one’s own body size can inXuence bodily action. We tested this by measuring the maximum grip aperture (MGA) parameter of grasping while eight subjects viewed a real size, enlarged or shrunken image of their hand reaching to grasp a cylinder. In the enlarged view condition, the MGA decreased relative to real size view, as if the grasping movement was actually executed with a physically larger hand, thus requiring a smaller grip aperture to grasp the cylinder. Interestingly, MGA remained smaller even after visual feedback was removed. In contrast, no eVect was found for the reduced view condition. This asymmetry may reXect the fact that enlargement of body parts is experienced more frequently than shrinkage, notably during normal growth. In conclusion, vision of the body can signiWcantly and persistently aVect the internal model of the body used for motor programming.},

This question was addressed here by exposing participants to either an enlarged, a shrunken, or an unmodified view of their own hand in a reach-to-grasp task toward a target of fixed dimensions. When presented with a visually larger hand, participants modified the kinematics of their grasping movement by reducing maximum grip aperture. This adjustment was carried over even when the hand was rendered invisible in subsequent trials, suggesting a stable modification of the bodily representation employed for the action. The effect was specific for the size of the grip aperture, leaving the other features of the reach-to-grasp movement unaffected. Reducing the visual size of the hand did not induce the opposite effect, although individual differences were found, which possibly depended on the degree of subject’s reliance on visual input. A control experiment suggested that the effect exerted by the vision of the enlarged hand could not be merely explained by simple global visual rescaling. Overall, our results suggest that visual information pertaining to the size of the body is accessed by the body schema and is prioritized over the proprioceptive input for motor control.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect the cortical activity when 7 healthy subjects imagine performing repetitive (0.5-Hz) flexion/extension movements of the right fingers or right toes, or horizontal movements of the tongue. We also collected functional images when the subjects actually executed these movements and used these data to define somatotopical representations in the motor areas. In this study, we relate the functional activation maps to cytoarchitectural population maps of areas 4a, 4p, and 6 in the same standard anatomical space. The important novel findings are 1) that imagery of hand movements specifically activates the hand sections of the contralateral primary motor cortex (area 4a) and the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex (area 6) and a hand representation located in the caudal cingulate motor area and the most ventral part of the supplementary motor area; 2) that when imagining making foot movements, the foot zones of the posterior part of the contralateral supplementary motor area (area 6) and the contralateral primary motor cortex (area 4a) are active; and 3) that imagery of tongue movements activates the tongue region of the primary motor cortex and the premotor cortex bilaterally (areas 4a, 4p, and 6). These results demonstrate that imagery of action engages the somatotopically organized sections of the primary motor cortex in a systematic manner as well as activating some body-part-specific representations in the nonprimary motor areas. Thus the content of the mental motor image, in this case the body part, is reflected in the pattern of motor cortical activation.},

While Longo, Azañón and Haggard (2010) propose a bottom-up model, Bermúdez (2017) emphasizes the top-down aspect of the information processing loop. We argue that both are only half of the story. Section 1 introduces what the issues are. Section 2 starts by explaining why the topdown, descending direction is necessary with the illustration from the ‘body-based tactile rescaling’ paradigm (de Vignemont, Ehrsson and Haggard, 2005). It then argues that the bottom-up, ascending direction is also necessary, and substantiates this view with recent research on skin space and tactile field (Haggard et al., 2017). Section 3 discusses the model’s application to body ownership and bodily self-representation. Implications also extend to topics such as sense modality individuation (Macpherson, 2011), the constancybased view of perception (Burge, 2010), and the perception/cognition divide (Firestone and Scholl, 2016).},

Here in two experiments we used a full body crossmodal congruency task in which visual distractors were presented on a photograph of the participant, another person, who was either familiar or unfamiliar, or an object. Results revealed that during the ‘self-condition’ CCEs were enhanced compared to the ‘other condition’. The CCE was similar for unfamiliar and familiar others. CCEs for the object condition were signiﬁcantly smaller. The results show that presentation of an irrelevant image of a body affects multimodal processing and that the effect is enhanced when that image is of the self. The results hold intriguing implications for body representation in social situations.},

When the motion of one rival stimulus was consistent with observers’ own hand movements, dominance durations of that stimulus were extended and, remarkably, suppression durations of that stimulus were abbreviated. Additional measurements revealed that this change in rivalry dynamics was not attributable to observers’ knowledge about the condition under test. Thus, self-generated actions can inﬂuence the resolution of perceptual conﬂict, even when the object being controlled falls outside of visual awareness.},

They thereby controlled the motion of one item, which was randomly either the target or any of the distractors, while the other items followed pre-recorded motion pathways. Performance was more accurate and less prone to degradation as set size increased when the target was the self-controlled item. An additional experiment confirmed that participant-controlled motion was not physically more salient than motion recorded offline. We found no evidence that self-controlled items captured attention.

Using a deceptive experimental design, we discovered that waving one’s own hand in front of one’s covered eyes can cause visual sensations of motion. Conjecturing that these visual sensations arise from multisensory connectivity, we showed that individuals with synesthesia experience substantially stronger kinesthesis-induced visual sensations. Finally, we found that the perceived vividness of kinesthesis-induced visual sensations predicted participants’ ability to smoothly eye-track self-generated hand movements in darkness, indicating that these sensations function like typical retinally-driven visual sensations.

	abstract = {Convergence of inputs from different sensory modalities onto individual neurons is a phenomenon that occurs widely throughout the brain at many phyletic levels and appears to represent a basic neural mechanism by which an organism integrates complex environmental stimuli. In the present study, neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) were used as a model to examine how single neurons deal with simultaneous cues from different sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, somatosensory). The functional result of multisensory convergence on an individual cell was determined by comparing the responses evoked from it by a combined-modality (multimodal) stimulus with those elicited by each (unimodal) component of that stimulus presented alone. Superior colliculus cells exhibited profound changes in their activity when individual sensory stimuli were combined. These "multisensory interactions" were found to be widespread among deep laminae cells and fell into one of two functional categories: response enhancement, characterized by a significant increase in the number of discharges evoked; and response depression, characterized by a significant decrease in the discharges elicited. Multisensory response interactions most often reflected a multiplicative, rather than summative, change in activity. Their absolute magnitude varied from cell to cell and, when stimulus conditions were altered, within the same cell. However, the percentage change of enhanced interactions was generally inversely related to the vigor of the responses that could be evoked by presenting each unimodal stimulus alone and suggest that the potential for response amplification was greatest when responses evoked by individual stimuli were weakest. The majority of cells exhibiting multi-sensory characteristics were demonstrated to have descending efferent projections and thus had access to premotor and motor areas of the brain stem and spinal cord involved in SC-mediated attentive and orientation behaviors. These data show that multisensory convergence provides the descending efferent cells of the SC with a dynamic response character. The responses of these cells and the SC-mediated behaviors that they underlie need not be immutably tied to the presence of any single stimulus, but can vary in response to the particular complex of stimuli present in the environment at any given moment.},

	abstract = {Given that multiple senses are often stimulated at the same time, perceptual awareness is most likely to take place in multisensory situations. However, theories of awareness are based on studies and models established for a single sense (mostly vision). Here, we consider the methodological and theoretical challenges raised by taking a multisensory perspective on perceptual awareness. First, we consider how well tasks designed to study unisensory awareness perform when used in multisensory settings, stressing that studies using binocular rivalry, bistable figure perception, continuous flash suppression, the attentional blink, repetition blindness and backward masking can demonstrate multisensory influences on unisensory awareness, but fall short of tackling multisensory awareness directly. Studies interested in the latter phenomenon rely on a method of subjective contrast and can, at best, delineate conditions under which individuals report experiencing a multisensory object or two unisensory objects. As there is not a perfect match between these conditions and those in which multisensory integration and binding occur, the link between awareness and binding advocated for visual information processing needs to be revised for multisensory cases. These challenges point at the need to question the very idea of multisensory awareness.},

	abstract = {Behavioral studies have used visuo-tactile conflicts between a participant's body and a visually presented fake or virtual body to investigate the importance of bodily perception for self-consciousness (bodily self-consciousness). Illusory self-identification with a fake body and changes in tactile processing—modulation of visuo-tactile cross-modal congruency effects (CCEs)—were reported in previous findings. Although proprioceptive signals are deemed important for bodily self-consciousness, their contribution to the representation of the full body has not been studied. Here we investigated whether and how self-identification and tactile processing (CCE magnitude) could be modified by altering proprioceptive signals with 80-Hz vibrations at the legs. Participants made elevation judgments of tactile cues (while ignoring nearby lights) during synchronous and asynchronous stroking of a seen fake body. We found that proprioceptive signals during vibrations altered the magnitude of self-identification and mislocalization of touch (CCE) in a synchrony-dependent fashion: we observed an increase of self-identification and CCE magnitude during asynchronous stroking. In a second control experiment we studied whether proprioceptive signals per se, or those from the lower limbs in particular, were essential for these changes. We applied vibrations at the upper limbs (which provide no information about the position of the participant's body in space) and in this case observed no modulation of bodily self-consciousness or tactile perception. These data link proprioceptive signals from the legs that are conveyed through the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway to bodily self-consciousness. We discuss their integration with bodily signals from vision and touch for full-body representations.},

	abstract = {How do we acquire a mental representation of our own face? Recently, synchronous, but not asynchronous, interpersonal multisensory stimulation (IMS) between one’s own and another person’s face has been used to evoke changes in self-identiﬁcation (enfacement illusion). We investigated the conscious experience of these changes with principal component analyses (PCA) that revealed that while the conscious experience during synchronous IMS focused on resemblance and similarity with the other’s face, during asynchronous IMS it focused on multisensory stimulation. Analyses of the identiﬁed common factor structure revealed signiﬁcant quantitative differences between synchronous and asynchronous IMS on self-identiﬁcation and perceived similarity with the other’s face. Experiment 2 revealed that participants with lower interoceptive sensitivity experienced stronger enfacement illusion. Overall, self-identiﬁcation and body-ownership rely on similar basic mechanisms of multisensory integration, but the effects of multisensory input on their experience are qualitatively different, possibly underlying the face’s unique role as a marker of selfhood.

The purpose of the current study was to further examine the rubber hand illusion with conditions of movement. An apparatus was devised that would synchronise visual with felt movement in an active condition and a passive condition. An asynchronous condition was included as a control in which visual and felt movement were purposely disconnected. The three movement conditions (active, passive, and asynchronous) were statistically compared in order to assess our prediction that synchronous conditions of movement (especially active) would generate more reports of the illusion. The performance of the movement conditions was evaluated against a visual-tactile condition, which is a known contributor to the rubber hand illusion. Not only significantly more robust reports of the illusion were obtained when visual movement and felt movement were synchronised but there was also a trend toward stronger reports in the active condition rather than the passive condition. Interestingly, the pattern of results differed according to the particular question on the self-report.},

The most commonly used dichotomy is based on the body image, thought to underlie perception and proven to be susceptible to bodily illusions, versus the body schema, hypothesized to guide actions and so far proven to be robust against bodily illusions. In this rubber hand illusion study we investigated the susceptibility of the body schema by manipulating the amount of stimulation on the rubber hand and the participant’s hand, adjusting the postural conﬁguration of the hand, and investigating a grasping rather than a pointing response. Observed results showed for the ﬁrst time altered grasping responses as a consequence of the grip aperture of the rubber hand. This illusion-sensitive motor response challenges one of the foundations on which the dichotomy is based, and addresses the importance of illusion induction versus type of response when investigating body representations.},

The instrument used for the investigation was the rubber hand illusion (RHI) where synchronous and asynchronous multimodal stimulation were applied. The study focused on assessing the rate of integration for visuo-tactile and visuo-proprioceptive stimuli. Methods: From a large sample of right-handed volunteers, 50 senior employees (containing younger and middle age adults) and 51 senior retired (senior adults) participants were recruited. Results: The between-subject analyses revealed that individuals both the junior and the senior participants responded to induction of RHI with vivid ownership and disownership experiences and a higher mislocalization error in the synchronous condition. However, the between-group analysis showed that participants in the senior group reported less vivid ownership and less vivid total RHI experiences scores compared to members of the junior group, but no mislocalization error differences were found between the groups. Conclusion: The results indicated that when visuo-tactile stimuli synchronously presented, the gain in multisensory integration decreased in seniors group. In contrast, in the case of visuo-proprioceptive synchronous presentation, the efﬁciency of multisensory integration remained unchanged across the lifespan.},

Here we investigated development of the ability to integrate vision with proprioception to localize the hand. We tested 109 4- to 12-year-olds and adults on a simple pointing task. Participants used an unseen hand beneath a table to point to targets presented on top of the table to vision alone, proprioception alone, or both together. Overall, 7- to 9-year-olds’ and adults’ points were significantly less variable given vision and proprioception together compared with either alone. However, this variance reduction was present at all ages in the subset of participants whose proprioceptive estimates were less than two times more variable than their visual. These results, together with analyses of cue weighting, indicate that all groups integrated vision and proprioception, but only 7- to 9-year-olds and adults consistently selected cue weights that were appropriate to their own single-cue reliabilities. Cue weights used at 4 – 6 and 10 –12 years still allowed over half of participants at these ages to reduce their pointing variability. One explanation for poorer group-level cue weighting at 10 –12 years is that this ages represents a period of relatively rapid physical growth. An existing Bayesian model of hand localization did not describe either adults’ or children’s data well, but the results suggest future improvements to the model.},

A recent study by Hillock-Dunn and Wallace (2012) reported that the size of the visuo-auditory temporal binding window — the interval within which visual and auditory inputs are highly likely to be integrated — narrows over childhood. However, few studies have investigated how sensitivity to temporal and spatial properties of multisensory integration underlying body representation develops in children. This is not only important for sensory processes but has also been argued to underpin social processes such as empathy and imitation (Schütz-Bosbach et al., 2006). We tested 4 to 11 year-olds’ ability to detect a spatial discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive inputs (Experiment One) and a temporal discrepancy between visual and tactile inputs (Experiment Two) for hand representation. The likelihood that children integrated spatially separated visuo-proprioceptive information, and temporally asynchronous visuo-tactile information, decreased signiﬁcantly with age. This suggests that spatial and temporal rules governing the occurrence of multisensory integration underlying body representation are reﬁned with age in typical development.},

	abstract = {Percepts about our body’s position in space and about body ownership are informed by multisensory feedback from visual, proprioceptive, and tactile inputs. The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) is a multisensory illusion that is induced when an observer sees a rubber hand being stroked while they feel their own, spatially displaced, and obstructed hand being stroked. When temporally synchronous, the visual–tactile interactions can create the illusion that the rubber hand belongs to the observer and that the observer’s real hand is shifted in position towards the rubber hand. Importantly, little is understood about whether these multisensory perceptions of the body change with older age. Thus, in this study we implemented a classic RHI protocol (synchronous versus asynchronous stroking) with healthy younger (18–35) and older (65+) adults and measured the magnitude of proprioceptive drift and the subjective experience of body ownership. As an adjunctive objective measure, skin temperature was recorded to evaluate whether decreases in skin temperature were associated with illusory percepts, as has been shown previously. The RHI was observed for both age groups with respect to increased drift and higher ratings of ownership following synchronous compared to asynchronous stroking. Importantly, no effects of age and no interactions between age and condition were observed for either of these outcome measures. No effects were observed for skin temperature. Overall, these results contribute to an emerging ﬁeld of research investigating the conditions under which age-related differences in multisensory integration are observed by providing insights into the role of visual, proprioceptive, and tactile inputs on bodily percepts.},

Here we extend the use of the RHI to examine the changes in the sense of body ownership related to healthy aging. Subjective reports (i.e., questionnaire) and proprioceptive drift were compared among young (n = 22, age range 20–22 years), middle-aged (n = 22, age range 44–55 years), and older adults (n = 22, age range 60–72 years). A stronger subjective experience of illusion was observed in the young and older adults as compared to the middle-aged. No differences in proprioceptive drift were found between the three groups. These findings are discussed in relation to: 1) different stages of development of perceptual and cognitive components of the sense of body ownership, and 2) compensatory mechanisms.},

In parallel, the kinesthetic mirror illusion elicits illusions of movement by moving the reflection of a participant’s arm. Experimental manipulation of sensory inputs leads to emergence of these multisensory illusions. There are strong conceptual similarities between these two illusions, suggesting that they rely on the same neurophysiological mechanisms, but this relationship has never been investigated. Studies indicate that participants differ in their sensitivity to these illusions, which provides a possibility for studying the relationship between these two illusions.
              Method
              . We tested 36 healthy participants to confirm that there exist reliable individual differences in sensitivity to the two illusions and that participants sensitive to one illusion are also sensitive to the other.
              Results
              . The results revealed that illusion sensitivity was very stable across trials and that individual differences in sensitivity to the kinesthetic mirror illusion were highly related to individual differences in sensitivity to the rubber hand illusion.
              Conclusions
              . Overall, these results support the idea that these two illusions may be both linked to a transitory modification of body schema, wherein the most sensitive people have the most malleable body schema.},

We found that feelings of owning a rubber hand in the SHRI paradigm, as assessed by explicit reports (i.e., questionnaire), are already present by age 4 and do not change throughout development. In contrast, the effect of the illusion on the sense of hand position, as assessed by a pointing task, was present only in 8- to 9-year-old children and adults; the magnitude of such capture increased with age. Our findings reveal that tactile-proprioceptive interactions contributed differently to the two aspects characterizing the SRHI: Although the contribution of such interactions to an explicit sense of self was similar across age groups, their contribution to the more implicit recalibration of hand position is still developing by age 9.},

	abstract = {Recent research suggests visuo-tactile binding is temporally extended in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), although it is not clear whether this specifically underlies altered body representation in this population. In the current study children and adolescents with ASD, and typically developing controls, placed their hand into mediated reality system (MIRAGE) and saw two identical live video images of their own right hand. One image was in the proprioceptively correct location (veridical hand) and the other was displaced to either side. While visuotactile feedback was applied via brushstroke to the participant’s (unseen) right finger, they viewed one hand image receiving synchronous brushstrokes and the other receiving brushstrokes with a temporal delay (60, 180 and 300ms). After brushing, both images disappeared from view and participants pointed to a target, with direction of movement indicating which hand was embodied. ASD participants, like younger mental aged-matched controls, showed reduced embodiment of the spatially incongruent, but temporally incongruent, hand compared to chronologically age-matched controls at shorter temporal delays. This suggests development of visuo-tactile integration may be delayed in ASD. Findings are discussed in relation to atypical body representation in ASD and how this may contribute to social and sensory difficulties within this population.},

By means of a novel action-based version of the rubber hand illusion (RHI), in which participants could actively self-stroke the rubber hand, with (Version 1) or without visual feedback (Version 2) of their own actions, we showed that self-generated actions promote the emergence of a sense of ownership over the rubber hand in children, while it interferes with the embodiment of the rubber hand in adults. When the movement is missing (Version 3, i.e., mere view of the rubber hand being stroked concurrently with one’s own hand), the pattern of results is reversed, with adults showing embodiment of the rubber hand, but children lacking to do so. Our novel ﬁndings reveal a dynamic and plastic contribution of the motor system to the emergence of a coherent bodily self, suggesting that the development of the sense of body ownership is shaped by motor experience, rather than being purely sensory.},

We investigated this question by measuring the strength of the rubber-hand illusion in young children (4 to 9 years old) and adults. Intermanual pointing showed that children were as sensitive as adults to visual-tactile synchrony cues for hand position, which indicates that a visual-tactile pathway to the bodily self matures by at least 4 years of age. However, regardless of synchrony cues, children’s perceived hand position was closer to the rubber hand than adults’ perceived hand position was. This indicates a second, later-maturing process based on visual-proprioceptive information. Furthermore, explicit feelings of embodiment were related only to the visual-tactile process. These findings demonstrate two dissociable processes underlying body representation in early life, and they call into question current models of body representation and ownership in adulthood.},

The accuracy of participants’ reaching was measured when proprioceptive and visual cues to the location of the right arm were put into conflict (by placing the arms at different distances from the mirror), and also when only proprioceptive information was available (i.e., when the mirror was covered). Children in all age-groups (and adults) made reaching errors in the mirror condition in accordance with the visually-specified illusory starting position of their hand indicating a visual capture of perceived hand position. Data analysis indicated that visual capture increased substantially up until 6 years of age.

We tested three age groups of children: 6-­ to 7-­year-­olds (n = 28); 8-­ to 9-­year-­olds (n = 21); 10-­ to 11-y­ ear-­olds (n = 19), and a group of adults (n = 31). Each participant wore a head-­mounted display (HMD) which displayed a view from a video camera positioned 2 metres behind their own back. Thus, they could view a virtual body from behind. We manipulated visuo-­ tactile synchrony by showing the participants a view of their virtual back being stroked with a stick at the same time and same place as their real back (synchronous condition), or at different times and places (asynchronous condition). After each period of stroking, we measured three aspects of bodily self-­consciousness: drift in perceived self-­location, self-­identification with the virtual body, and touch referral to the virtual body. Results show that self-­identification with the virtual body was significantly stronger in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition even in the youngest group tested; however, the size of this effect increased with age. Touch referral to the virtual body was greater in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition only for 10-­  to 11-y­ ear-­olds and adults. Drift in perceived self-­location was greater in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition only for adults. Thus, the youngest age tested can self-­identify with a virtual body, but the links between multisensory signals and bodily self-c­ onsciousness develop significantly across childhood. This suggests a long period of development of the bodily self and exciting potential for the use of virtual reality technologies with children.},

The present experiment shows that the position of the arm is represented in the premotor cortex of the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brain by means of a convergence of visual cues and proprioceptive cues onto the same neurons. These neurons respond to the felt position of the arm when the arm is covered from view. They also respond in a similar fashion to the seen position of a false arm.},

Here we investigated whether the visual information provided by the movement of self body-parts may be separately processed by right brain-damaged (RBD) patients and constitute a valuable cue to reduce their deﬁcit in self body-parts processing. To pursue these aims, neurological healthy subjects and RBD patients were submitted to a matching-task of a pair of subsequent visual stimuli, in two conditions. In the dynamic condition, participants were shown movies of moving body-parts (hand, foot, arm and leg); in the static condition, participants were shown still images of the same body-parts. In each condition, on half of the trials at least one stimulus in the pair was from the participant’s own body (‘Self’ condition), whereas on the remaining half of the trials both stimuli were from another person (‘Other’ condition). Results showed that in healthy participants the self-advantage was present when processing both static and dynamic body-parts, but it was more important in the latter condition. In RBD patients, however, the self-advantage was absent in the static, but present in the dynamic body-parts condition. These ﬁndings suggest that visual information from self body-parts in motion may be processed independently in patients with impaired static self-processing, thus pointing to a modular organization of the mechanisms responsible for the self/other distinction.},

From our own body we wish to combine visual information with, at least, somatosensory, proprioceptive and motor information in order to guide our interpretation of sensory events and our actions upon the world. For others' bodies we only have visual information available, but from that we can derive much useful social information including their age, health, gender, emotional state and intentions. Consequently, a challenge for the brain is to sort visual images of our own bodies, to be integrated with processing from other sensory modalities, from highly similar images of others' bodies for social cognition. We explored the possibility that the extrastriate body area (EBA) may help to accomplish this sorting. Previous work had suggested that the EBA is responsive to images of both our own and others' body parts but does not distinguish between them. Here, using fMRI adaptation, we provide evidence that the right EBA contains separate neural sub-populations that are selectively sensitive to images of our own or others' body parts. Thus, we argue that the right EBA may perform an important sorting of body part images by identity (including self-recognition) and may interact both with brain areas involved in sensory processing and social cognition having identiﬁed our own and others' body part images respectively.},

	abstract = {Recent results indicate that crossmodal interactions can affect activity in cortical regions traditionally regarded as “unimodal.” Previously we found that combining touch on one hand with visual stimulation in the anatomically corresponding hemifield could boost responses in contralateral visual cortex. Here we manipulated which visual hemifield corresponded to the location of the stimulated hand, by changing gaze direction such that right-hand touch could now arise in either the left or right visual field. Crossmodal effects on visual cortex switched from one hemisphere to the other, depending on gaze direction, regardless of whether the hand was seen. This indicates that crossmodal influences of touch upon visual cortex depend on spatial alignment for the multimodal stimuli, with gaze posture taken into account.},

The eﬀective piloting of the body to avoid or manipulate objects in pursuit of behavioural goals requires an integrated neural representation of the body (the ‘body schema’) and of the space around the body (‘peripersonal space’). In the review that follows, we describe and evaluate recent results from neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and psychophysics in both human and non-human primates that support the existence of an integrated representation of visual, somatosensory, and auditory peripersonal space. Such a representation involves primarily visual, somatosensory, and proprioceptive modalities, operates in body-part-centred reference frames, and demonstrates signiﬁcant plasticity. Recent research shows that the use of tools, the viewing of one’s body or body parts in mirrors, and in video monitors, may also modulate the visuotactile representation of peripersonal space.},

Thirty-two participants took part in a between-groups study to puppeteer the avatar in an immersive CAVETM -like system. Participants’ body movement was tracked, and the avatar’s humanoid body synchronously reﬂected this motion. However, sixteen participants experienced the avatar’s tail moving around randomly and asynchronous to their own movement, while the other participants experienced a tail that they could, potentially, control accurately and synchronously through hip movement. Participants in the synchronous condition experienced a higher degree of body ownership and agency, suggesting that visuomotor synchrony enhanced the probability of ownership over the avatar body despite of its extra-human form. Participants experiencing body ownership were also more likely to be more anxious and attempt to avoid virtual threats to the tail and body. The higher task performance of participants in the synchronous condition indicates that people are able to quickly learn how to remap normal degrees of bodily freedom in order to control virtual bodies that differ from the humanoid form. We discuss the implications and applications of extended humanoid avatars as a method for exploring the plasticity of the brain’s representation of the body and for gestural human-computer interfaces.},

	abstract = {Background: Our body schema gives the subjective impression of being highly stable. However, a number of easily-evoked illusions illustrate its remarkable malleability. In the rubber-hand illusion, illusory ownership of a rubber-hand is evoked by synchronous visual and tactile stimulation on a visible rubber arm and on the hidden real arm. Ownership is concurrent with a proprioceptive illusion of displacement of the arm position towards the fake arm. We have previously shown that this illusion of ownership plus the proprioceptive displacement also occurs towards a virtual 3D projection of an arm when the appropriate synchronous visuotactile stimulation is provided. Our objective here was to explore whether these illusions (ownership and proprioceptive displacement) can be induced by only synchronous visuomotor stimulation, in the absence of tactile stimulation.
Methodology/Principal Findings: To achieve this we used a data-glove that uses sensors transmitting the positions of fingers to a virtually projected hand in the synchronous but not in the asynchronous condition. The illusion of ownership was measured by means of questionnaires. Questions related to ownership gave significantly larger values for the synchronous than for the asynchronous condition. Proprioceptive displacement provided an objective measure of the illusion and had a median value of 3.5 cm difference between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. In addition, the correlation between the feeling of ownership of the virtual arm and the size of the drift was significant.
Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that synchrony between visual and proprioceptive information along with motor activity is able to induce an illusion of ownership over a virtual arm. This has implications regarding the brain mechanisms underlying body ownership as well as the use of virtual bodies in therapies and rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {In three experiments we investigated the effects of visuo-tactile and visuo-vestibular conflict about the direction of gravity on three aspects of bodily self-consciousness: self-identification, self-location, and the experienced direction of the firstperson perspective. Robotic visuo-tactile stimulation was administered to 78 participants in three experiments. Additionally, we presented participants with a virtual body as seen from an elevated and downward-directed perspective while they were lying supine and were therefore receiving vestibular and postural cues about an upward-directed perspective. Under these conditions, we studied the effects of different degrees of visuo-vestibular conflict, repeated measurements during illusion induction, and the relationship to a classical measure of visuo-vestibular integration. Extending earlier findings on experimentally induced changes in bodily self-consciousness, we show that self-identification does not depend on the experienced direction of the first-person perspective, whereas self-location does. Changes in bodily self-consciousness depend on visual gravitational signals. Individual differences in the experienced direction of first-person perspective correlated with individual differences in visuo-vestibular integration. Our data reveal important contributions of visuovestibular gravitational cues to bodily self-consciousness. In particular we show that the experienced direction of the firstperson perspective depends on the integration of visual, vestibular, and tactile signals, as well as on individual differences in idiosyncratic visuo-vestibular strategies.},

Despite a wealth of neurophysiological and neuroimaging research on the representations of the spatial environment in the parietal and medial temporal cortices, the relationship between body ownership and self-location remains unexplored. To investigate this relationship, we used a multisensory out-of-body illusion to manipulate healthy participants’ perceived self-location, head direction, and sense of body ownership during high-resolution fMRI. Activity patterns in the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, and intraparietal cortices reﬂected the sense of self-location, whereas the sense of body ownership was associated with premotor-intraparietal activity. The functional interplay between these two sets of areas was mediated by the posterior cingulate cortex. These results extend our understanding of the role of the posterior parietal and medial temporal cortices in spatial cognition by demonstrating that these areas not only are important for ecological behaviors, such as navigation and perspective taking, but also support the perceptual representation of the bodily self in space. Our results further suggest that the posterior cingulate cortex has a key role in integrating the neural representations of self-location and body ownership.},

Although this topic has not been the subject of investigation in science, it exemplifies the fundamental question of why we have an ongoing experience of being located inside our bodies. Here we report a perceptual illusion of body-swapping that addresses directly this issue. Manipulation of the visual perspective, in combination with the receipt of correlated multisensory information from the body was sufficient to trigger the illusion that another person’s body or an artificial body was one’s own. This effect was so strong that people could experience being in another person’s body when facing their own body and shaking hands with it. Our results are of fundamental importance because they identify the perceptual processes that produce the feeling of ownership of one’s body.},

Earlier studies suggest that integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information in multisensory areas [7–11] mediates self-attribution of single limbs. However, it is still unknown how ownership of individual body parts translates into the unitary experience of owning a whole body. Here, we used a ‘‘body-swap’’ illusion [12], in which people experienced an artiﬁcial body to be their own, in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging to reveal a coupling between the experience of full-body ownership and neural responses in bilateral ventral premotor and left intraparietal cortices, and left putamen. Importantly, activity in the ventral premotor cortex reﬂected the construction of ownership of a whole body from the parts, because it was stronger when the stimulated body part was attached to a body, was present irrespective of whether the illusion was triggered by stimulation of the hand or the abdomen, and displayed multivoxel patterns carrying information about full-body ownership. These ﬁndings suggest that the unitary experience of owning an entire body is produced by neuronal populations that integrate multisensory information across body segments.},

In representing the position of their own hand in external space, children of this age rely more on the sight of the hand, and less on its proprioceptively felt position, than adults do. The current study investigated when during later childhood the balance between visual and proprioceptive inputs reaches an adult-like weighting. After inducing the rubber hand illusion in 10- to 13-year-olds, we asked participants to point, with eyes closed, to the perceived position of their hand. We found that pointing responses reached adult levels at 10 to 11 years, showing that at this age children perceive hand location using an adult-like balance of sensory cues. We conclude that the multisensory foundations of the bodily self undergo a protracted period of development through early and mid-childhood, reaching an adult state by 10 to 11 years.},

While studying consciousness in the visual modality presents clear advantages, we believe that a comprehensive scientiﬁc account of subjective experience must not neglect other exteroceptive and interoceptive signals as well as the role of multisensory interactions for perceptual and self-consciousness. Here, we brieﬂy review four distinct lines of work which converge in documenting how multisensory signals are processed across several levels and contents of consciousness. Namely, how multisensory interactions occur when consciousness is prevented because of perceptual manipulations (i.e. subliminal stimuli) or because of low vigilance states (i.e. sleep, anesthesia), how interactions between exteroceptive and interoceptive signals give rise to bodily self-consciousness, and how multisensory signals are combined to form metacognitive judgments. By describing the interactions between multisensory signals at the perceptual, cognitive, and metacognitive levels, we illustrate how stepping out the visual comfort zone may help in deriving reﬁned accounts of consciousness, and may allow cancelling out idiosyncrasies of each sense to delineate supramodal mechanisms involved during consciousness.},

	abstract = {Background: People with anorexia nervosa (AN) usually report feeling broader than they really are. The objective of the present study was to better understand the body schema's involvement in this false self-representation in AN. We tested the potential for correction of the body schema impairment via the sensorimotor feedback provided by a real, executed action and relative to an imagined action. We also took account of the impact of the AN patients’ weight variations on the task outcomes.
Methods: Fourteen inpatient participants with AN and fourteen control participants were presented with a doorway-like aperture. The participants had to (i) judge whether or not various apertures were wide enough for them to pass through in a motor imagery task and then (ii) actually perform the action by passing through various apertures.
Results: We observed a higher passability ratio (i.e. the ratio between the critical aperture size and shoulder width) in participants with AN (relative to controls) for both motor imagery and real action. Moreover, the magnitude of the passability ratio was positively correlated with weight recovery.
Conclusion: The body schema alteration in AN appears to be strong enough to affect the patient's actions. Furthermore, the alteration resists correction by the sensorimotor feedback generated during action. This bias is linked to weight variations. The central nervous system might be locked to a false representation of the body that cannot be updated. Moreover, these results prompt us to suggest that emotional burden during weight recovery could also alter sensorimotor aspects of body representation. New therapeutic methods should take account of body schema alterations in AN as adjuncts to psychotherapy.},

Recent neurophysiological studies indicate that these maps are potentially modifiable through alterations in their sensory input. We present evidence that the apparent shape and orientation of the body can be changed within seconds by using muscle vibration to generate proprioceptive misinformation about limb position. Depending on the position of the hands or feet in relation to the rest of the body and to the test chamber, it is possible to generate systematic perceptual distortions of the body and changes in the apparent orientation of the body. Some implications of these observations for the maintenance of an accurate body schema, for spatial orientation, and for the encoding of ocular position are described.},

According to the enactive approach, human minds understand the world by virtue of the ways our bodies can act relative to it, or the ways we can imagine acting. This requires that action be distinguished from passivity, that the mental be approached from a ﬁrst person perspective, and that the cognitive capacities of the brain be grounded in the emotional and motivational processes that guide action and anticipate action affordances. It avoids the old intractable problems inherent in the computationalist approaches of twentieth century atomism and radical empiricism, and again allows phenomenology to bridge to neuropsychology in the way Merleau-Ponty was already doing over half a century ago.},

This work is devoted to explore possible individual age-related differences in shaping changes in body representations induced with a full-body illusion. A total of 40 women were divided into two different age groups according to the median of the variable age. Participants estimated the width of three different body parts (i.e., shoulders, abdomen, and hips) before the entire illusion was induced (baseline), and after the synchronous and the asynchronous conditions. Results revealed that 26-to-55-year-old participants were more resistant to changes induced by the bodily illusion, whereas 19-to-25-year-old participants underestimated their bodies after both conditions. The ﬁndings were discussed in terms of the literature exploring age differences in responses to bodily illusion, which could suggest a Bayesian mechanism underlying these individual differences.},

Thus, when touch is seen to be applied to a rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding hidden real hand, an illusion of ownership of the rubber hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand. This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution illusions. However, such studies have only ever manipulated a single factor and although they used a form of virtual reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual reality (IVR) to produce radical transformations in body ownership.},

Recent evidence, however, suggests that low-level bottom-up mechanisms of multi-sensory integration play a fundamental role in encoding speciﬁc components of bodily self-consciousness, such as self-location and ﬁrst-person perspective (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Self-location and ﬁrst-person perspective are abnormal in neurological patients suffering from out-of-body experiences (Blanke et al., 2004), and can be manipulated experimentally in healthy subjects by imposing multi-sensory conﬂicts (Lenggenhager et al., 2009). Activity of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) reﬂects experimentally induced changes in self-location and ﬁrst-person perspective (Ionta et al., 2011), and dysfunctions in TPJ are causally associated with out-of-body experiences (Blanke et al., 2002). We argue that TPJ is one of the key areas for multi-sensory integration of bodily self-consciousness, that its levels of activity reﬂect the experience of the conscious “I” as embodied and localized within bodily space, and that these mechanisms can be systematically investigated using state of the art technologies such as robotics, virtual reality, and non-invasive neuroimaging.},

This phenomenological differentiation forms the basis for Helmuth Plessner’s anthropological theory of the mediated or eccentric nature of human embodiment, that is, simultaneously we both are a body and have a body. Here, I want to focus on the extent to which this double aspect of embodiment (qua Leib and Körper) relates to our experience of temporality. Indeed, to question, does this double bodily relation correspond to a twofold temporality of embodied intentionality? In the first part of this paper, I differentiate between the intentional temporality of being a body and the temporal experience of having a body. To further my argument, in the second part, I present examples of specific pathologies, as well as liminal cases of bodily experiences, wherein these temporal dimensions, which otherwise go hand-in-hand, become dissociated. Phenomenologically, I want to argue that Husserl’s differentiation between Leib and Körper corresponds to two genetic forms of intentionality – operative and act (or object) intentionality – and that these are, in turn, characterized by different temporalities. Anthropologically, I want to argue that having a body – what occurs as an inherent break to human embodiment – is the presupposition for the experience of a stable and object-like time. I will conclude that the double aspect of human embodiment and in particular the thematic experience of having a body enables both the experience of a past, which is remembered, and a future that is planned.},

	abstract = {In the study of consciousness, neurophenomenology was originally established as a novel research program attempting to reconcile two apparently irreconcilable methodologies in psychology: qualitative and quantitative methods. Its potential relies on Francisco Varela’s idea of reciprocal constraints, in which first-person accounts and neurophysiological data mutually inform each other. However, since its first conceptualization, neurophenomenology has encountered methodological problems. These problems have emerged mainly because of the difficulty of obtaining and analyzing subjective reports in a systematic manner. However, more recently, several interview techniques for describing subjective accounts have been developed, collectively known as “second-person methods.” Second-person methods refer to interview techniques that solicit both verbal and non-verbal information from participants in order to obtain systematic and detailed subjective reports. Here, we examine the potential for employing second-person methodologies in the neurophenomenological study of consciousness and we propose three practical ideas for developing a second-person neurophenomenological method. Thus, we first describe second-person methodologies available in the literature for analyzing subjective reports, identifying specific constraints on the status of the first-, second- and third- person methods. Second, we analyze two experimental studies that explicitly incorporate second-person methods for traversing the “gap” between phenomenology and neuroscience. Third, we analyze the challenges that second-person accounts face in establishing an objective methodology for comparing results across different participants and interviewers: this is the “validation” problem. Finally, we synthesize the common aspects of the interview methods described above. In conclusion, our arguments emphasize that second-person methods represent a powerful approach for closing the gap between the experiential and the neurobiological levels of description in the study of human consciousness.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that the rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an experimental paradigm that has been widely used in the last 14 years to investigate different aspects of the sense of bodily self, very few studies have sought to investigate the subjective nature of the experience that the RHI evokes. The present study investigates the phenomenology of the RHI through a speciﬁc elicitation method. More particularly, this study aims at assessing whether the conditions usually used as control in the RHI have an impact in the sense of body ownership and at determining whether there are different stages in the emergence of the illusion. The results indicate that far from being “all or nothing,” the illusion induced by the RHI protocol involves nuances in the type of perceptual changes that it creates. These perceptual changes affect not only the participants’ perception of the rubber hand but also the perception of their real hand. In addition, perceptual effects may vary greatly between participants and, importantly, they evolve over time.},

	abstract = {Awareness of mental events as mere representations rather than as accurate depictions of reality, also known as dereification, is one of the key features of mindfulness meditation. Dereification is juxtaposed to subjective realism, the process of being lost or totally immersed in the contents of one's mind. Excessive subjective realism is a hallmark of several psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated whether a “mindful” (dereified) compared with an “immersed” (highly subjectively real) attitude, induced by instructions, differentially modulates approach-avoidance tendencies when processing visual stimuli. We presented novices and experienced meditators with neutral and attractive food images under both mindful and immersed states. Then, participants performed an approach–avoidance Task (AAT) during which we obtained behavioral data, salivary volume, EEG recordings, and self-report measures. The approach bias toward attractive food was correlated with N2 amplitude, a marker of response inhibition, and the regulation of this bias by the mindful instruction compared to the immersed instruction was associated with a modulation of the visual N1 amplitude, a marker of early selective attention. Individuals with more expertise in mindfulness meditation engaged in less late affective reappraisal during mindfulness than during immersion, as measured by lower amplitude in the late positive potential (LPP). Additionally, the ERPs sensitive to the AAT manipulation was also associated to self-report measures of subjective realism, food bias, and mindfulness meditation expertise but not to salivation measures. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which mindfulness-based interventions could be effective in a range of psychiatric conditions.},

They babble and touch their own body, attracted and actively involved in investigating the rich intermodal redundancies, temporal contingencies, and spatial congruence of self-perception. Recent research is presented, which investigats the spatial and temporal determinants of selfperception and action infancy. This research shows that, in the course of the first weeks of life, infants develop an ability to detect intermodal invariants and regularities in their sensorimotor experience, which specify themselves as separate entities agent in the environment. Recent observations on the detection of intermodal invariants regarding self-produced leg movements and auditory feedback of sucking by young infants are reported. These observations demonstrate that, early in development and long before mirror self-recognition, infants develop a perceptual ability to specify themselves. It is tentatively proposed that young infants' propensity to engage in self-perception and systematic exploration of the perceptual consequences of their own action plays an important role in the intermodal calibration of the body and is probably at the origin of an early sense of self: the ecological self.},

	abstract = {Background. Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) overestimate their size despite being severely underweight. Whether this misperception echoes an underlying emotional disturbance or also reﬂects a genuine bodyrepresentation deﬁcit is debatable. Current measures inquire directly about subjective perception of body image, thus distinguishing poorly between top-down eﬀects of emotions/attitudes towards the body and disturbances due to proprioceptive disorders/distorted body schema. Disorders of body representation also emerge following damage to the right parietal lobe. The possibility that parietal dysfunction might contribute to AN is suspected, based on the demonstrated association of spatial impairments, comparable to those found after parietal lesion, with this syndrome.
Method. We used a behavioral task to compare body knowledge in severe anorexics (n=8), healthy volunteers (n=11) and stroke patients with focal damage to the left/right parietal lobe (n=4). We applied a psychophysical procedure based on the perception, in the dark, of an approaching visual stimulus that was turned oﬀ before reaching the observer. Participants had to predict whether the stimulus would have hit/missed their body, had it continued its linear motion.
Results. Healthy volunteers and left parietal patients estimated body boundaries very close to the real ones. Conversely, anorexics and right parietal patients underestimated eccentricity of their left body boundary.
Conclusions. These ﬁndings are in line with the role the parietal cortex plays in developing and maintaining body representation, and support the possibility for a neuropsychological component in the pathogenesis of anorexia, oﬀering alternative approaches to treatment of the disorder.},

	abstract = {A critical issue related to the notion of identity concerns our ability to discriminate between internally and externally generated stimuli. This basic mechanism likely relies on perceptual and motor information, and requires that both motor plans and the resulting activity be continuously mapped on a reliable body representation. It has been widely demonstrated that the parietal cortices of the two hemispheres play a crucial role, albeit differently specialized, in both monitoring internal representation of our own actions and sustaining body representation. Ample neuropsychological evidence indicates that while damage to the left parietal cortex affects the ability to generate and/or monitor an internal model of one’s own movement, lesions of the right parietal lobe are largely responsible for severe perturbations of the internal representation of one’s own body. In the present paper, we discuss the processes involved in body perception and self-recognition and propose a tentative model describing how the right and left parietal cortices contribute in integrating various sources of information to produce the unique, elementary experience of one’s own body in motion. The ecological value of this process in constructing identity and autobiographical experience will be discussed.},

Females with AN who overestimated their own body size judged size differences between pictures of their own body, and then again of someone else’s body. Signal detection analysis of the results showed no differences in perceptual sensitivity between the AN and normal and thin control groups. No signiﬁcant correlations were found between body size estimates and perceptual sensitivity. The anorexic group did, however, show a bias to report seeing “thin” differences, which was opposite to that of thin controls. Because bias differences between the groups were signiﬁcant while sensitivity differences were not, it was concluded that abnormalities of body image most probably arise during reconstruction of the visual body image, rather than during perception of the body. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Body mass index and age were also included in the analyses. Regression analyses demonstrated that sociocultural influences and feedback from the participant's best male friend were important predictors for all body-change strategies among boys. For girls, sociocultural influences and feedback from the participant's best female friend and mother were important predictors for body-change strategies. The most consistent predictor of weight loss, weight gain, and strategies to increase muscles was bodyimage importance. In Study 2, the authors examined the influence of the same sociocultural variables, as well as negative affect and puberty on body image and body-change strategies among a second group of 199 boys and 267 girls. The results demonstrated that a broad range of sociocultural influences predicted body-change strategies for boys and girls, with negative affect also having a unique influence for boys but not for girls. Puberty played a minor role, once other sociocultural variables were entered into the regression equation. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Thirty-six adults (24 males, 12 females) were assessed for anthropometric somatotype and body image (perception and satisfaction) by a novel technique using quantitative distortion of a digital still image. Software produced random distortions in nine body regions. The participants manipulated interactive slider controls to adjust each body feature in turn, recreate their perceived image and indicate their desired image. There were no differences in perception between the sexes. However, the ideal–actual differences (i.e. satisfaction) indicated that males desired larger and females smaller features, respectively, in the chest and thighs (P 50.001) and arms and calves (P 50.01). When the male-derived data were partitioned by sport (strength, endurance, team-sport and controls), differences were found in the perceived image size in the chest and rib regions (P 50.01 and P 50.05, respectively). Strength athletes perceived these areas to be smaller and the control group perceived these areas to be larger than the true values. Somatotype analysis indicated that the physique associated with minimal dissatisfaction was 2.0–5.0–3.0 for males and 3.0–2.5–3.0 for females. Cluster analysis, combining anthropometric and satisfaction data, revealed seven distinct subgroups distinguished by particular attributes of physical appearance. We conclude that the method is reliable and that body image includes sex-speciﬁc, anthropometric, perceptual and personality-related components.},

Three activities that are known to enjoy popularity among young people were analysed, namely: dancing, playing computer games that require motor involvement (e.g. Kinect), and playing computer games of an educational and entertaining character. It was assumed that the chosen forms of activity correspond to three levels of activation of the body schema. The following research methods have been applied to this study: the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES), the Defence Style Questionnaire (DSQ), and the Bodily Self Representation Questionnaire. The study has proven that the activation of body schema through dance is significantly related to high self-esteem and the use of mainly mature and neurotic defence mechanisms in threat situations.},

First, we tested the temporal constraint of multisensory integration, as measured by the temporal binding window. Second, we tested multisensory body representation, as indexed by the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI). Results showed that allergic participants have a narrower temporal binding window and are less susceptible to the RHI than healthy controls.},

The evidence is based on the double dissociation between disorders of perceptual detection and sensorimotor guidance. Until now, research focused on cases that had impaired tactile pressure sensitivity and comparisons of performance were of cases suffering from different types of lesions (peripheral and central). Here, we report a unique double dissociation in two stroke patients with intact basic somatosensory processing (tactile detection). One patient was poor at identifying the position of where she had been touched on a line drawing of a hand, but was able to point accurately towards the actual position on her/his hand itself. The reverse pattern was observed in the other patient. This ﬁnding provides further support for separate processing for body image and body scheme.},

It is controversial whether such symptoms are secondary to psychosocial influences, are a consequence of obsessions and anxiety or reflect a primary disturbance of brain appetitive circuits. New brain imaging technology provides insights into ventral and dorsal neural circuit dysfunction — perhaps related to altered serotonin and dopamine metabolism — that contributes to the puzzling symptoms found in people with eating disorders. For example, altered insula activity could explain interoceptive dysfunction, and altered striatal activity might shed light on altered reward modulation in people with anorexia nervosa.},

The PC is also the anatomical substrate of a supramodal reference framework involved in spatial orientation constancy. Given the impaired spatial orientation constancy found in hemineglect, we sought to determine whether similar disturbances could be observed in anorexic patients. We investigated the effect of passive lateral body inclination on the tactile subjective vertical (SV). Fifty participants (25 AN patients and 25 healthy controls) were asked to manually set a rod into the vertical position under three postural conditions. For tilted conditions, we observed a signiﬁcant deviation of the tactile SV towards the body. This effect was abnormally accentuated in AN patients and might be caused by higher weighting with respect to the egocentric frame of reference. Our ﬁndings reinforce the role of the PC in AN and suggest that this dysfunction affects spatial orientation constancy as well as body boundaries.},

	abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder that typically emerges during adolescence and occurs most frequently in females. To date, very few studies have investigated the possible impact of AN on white matter tissue properties during adolescence, when white matter is still developing. The present study evaluated white matter tissue properties in adolescent girls with AN using diffusion MRI with tractography and T1 relaxometry to measure R1 (1/T1), an index of myelin content. Fifteen adolescent girls with AN (mean age = 16.6 years ± 1.4) were compared to ﬁfteen age-matched girls with normal weight and eating behaviors (mean age = 17.1 years ± 1.3). We identiﬁed and segmented 9 bilateral cerebral tracts (18) and 8 callosal ﬁber tracts in each participant's brain (26 total). Tract proﬁles were generated by computing measures for fractional anisotropy (FA) and R1 along the trajectory of each tract. Compared to controls, FA in the AN group was signiﬁcantly decreased in 4 of 26 white matter tracts and signiﬁcantly increased in 2 of 26 white matter tracts. R1 was signiﬁcantly decreased in the AN group compared to controls in 11 of 26 white matter tracts. Reduced FA in combination with reduced R1 suggests that the observed white matter differences in AN are likely due to reductions in myelin content. For the majority of tracts, group differences in FA and R1 did not occur within the same tract. The present ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the neurobiological factors underlying white matter changes associated with AN and invite further investigations examining associations between white matter properties and speciﬁc physiological, cognitive, social, or emotional functions affected in AN.},

	abstract = {Objective—The neurobiological underpinnings of anorexia nervosa (AN) are poorly understood. In this study we tested whether brain gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in adolescents with AN would show alterations comparable to adults.
Method—We used magnetic resonance imaging to study GM and WM volume, and diffusion tensor imaging to assess fractional anisotropy for WM integrity in 19 adolescents with AN and 22 controls.
Results—Individuals with AN showed greater left orbitofrontal, right insular, and bilateral temporal cortex GM, as well as temporal lobe WM volumes compared to controls. WM integrity in adolescents with AN was lower (lower fractional anisotropy) in fornix, posterior frontal, and parietal areas, but higher in anterior frontal, orbitofrontal, and temporal lobes. In individuals with AN, orbitofrontal GM volume correlated negatively with sweet taste pleasantness. An additional comparison of this study cohort with adult individuals with AN and healthy controls supported greater orbitofrontal cortex and insula volumes in AN across age groups.
Conclusions—This study indicates larger orbitofrontal and insular GM volumes, as well as lower fornix WM integrity in adolescents with AN, similar to adults. The pattern of larger anteroventral GM and WM volume as well as WM integrity, but lower WM integrity in posterior frontal and parietal regions may indicate that developmental factors such as GM pruning and WM growth could contribute to brain alterations in AN. The negative correlation between taste pleasantness and orbitofrontal cortex volume in individuals with AN could contribute to food avoidance in this disorder.},

Twelve anorexia nervosa (DSM-IV) patients aged 11–17 consecutively admitted to an Eating Disorders Unit were assessed by means of psychopathological scales, neuropsychological battery and voxel-based morphometric (VBM) magnetic resonance imaging at admission and after 7 months’ follow-up. Nine control subjects of similar age, gender and estimated intelligence level were also studied. The two groups showed diﬀerences in gray matter (F = 22.2; p {\textless} 0.001) and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) (F = 21.2; p {\textless} 0.001) but not in white matter volumes. In anorexic patients, gray matter volume correlated negatively with the copy time from the Rey Complex Figure Test. In the regional VBM study several temporal and parietal gray matter regions were reduced. During follow-up there was a greater global increase in gray matter (F = 10.7; p = 0.004) and decrease in CSF (F = 22.1; p = 0.001) in anorexic patients. The increase in gray matter correlated with a decrease in cortisol (Spearman correlation = À0.73; p = 0.017). At follow-up there were no diﬀerences in global gray matter (F = 2.1; p = 0.165), white matter (F = 0.02, p = 0.965) or CSF (F = 1.8; p = 0.113) volumes between both groups. There were still some smaller areas, in the right temporal and both supplementary motor area, showing diﬀerences between them in the regional VBM study. In conclusion, in adolescent anorexic patients gray matter is more aﬀected than white matter and mainly involves the posterior regions of the brain. Overall gray matter alterations are reversible after nutritional recovery.},

	abstract = {In the current study, we adopted the hypothesis that the body scheme disturbances occurring during adolescence might lead subjects to transiently neglect proprioceptive information and that adolescents might rely more strongly on vision to control their orientation and stabilize their body. To check this point, we asked adolescents 14–15 years to maintain vertical stance while very slow sinusoidal oscillations in the frontal plane were applied to the supporting platform at 0.01 Hz (below the detection threshold of the semicircular canal system) and at 0.06 Hz (above) with the eyes open and closed. Two postural components, orientation and segmental stabilization, were analyzed at the head, shoulder, trunk, and pelvis levels. At the lowest frequency without vision, the performances of adolescents were much less efficient than those of adults. Moreover, this study showed that vision plays a predominant role in adolescents’ control of orientation and body stabilization. At 0.06 Hz without vision, a clearcut difference was observed between the strategies used by girls and boys; specifically, the maturation of the segmental stabilization processes was found to be more advanced in girls than in boys. However, no such difference was observed at 0.01 Hz. Lastly, comparisons between the data obtained in adolescents and those previously obtained in young adults (Vaugoyeau, Viel, Amblard, Azulay, \& Assaiante, 2008) clearly show that adolescents use different postural strategies and that they are not yet capable of reaching comparable postural performance levels to those observed in adults. Because adolescents were not able to use the proprioceptive information available to improve their postural control, we concluded that they showed a maturational lag in comparison with adults. This suggests that the mechanisms underlying postural control are still maturing during adolescence, which might constitute a transient period of proprioceptive neglect in sensory integration of postural control.},

Acknowledging such functionality oﬀers possibilities for obtaining traction on investigation of neural correlates of selfhood. A method that has potential for investigating some of the brain-based properties of self arising in behavioral contexts varying in requirements for such behavioral guidance and control is functional brain imaging. Data obtained with this method are beginning to converge on a set of brain areas that appear to play a signiﬁcant role in permitting conscious access to representational content having reference to self as an embodied and independent experiencer and agent. These areas have been identiﬁed in a variety of imaging contexts ranging from passive state conditions in which they appear to manifest ongoing activity associated with spontaneous and typically Ôself-relatedÕ cognition, to tasks targeting explicitly experienced properties of self, to demanding task conditions where activity within them is attenuated in apparent redirection of cognitive resources in the service of task guidance and control. In this paper, these data will be reviewed and a hypothesis presented regarding a signiﬁcant role for these areas in enabling degrees of self-awareness and participating in the management of such behavioral control.},

	abstract = {Many psychiatric disorders are associated with abnormal self-processing. While these disorders also have a wide-range of complex, and often heterogeneous sets of symptoms involving different cognitive, emotional, and motor domains, an impaired sense of self can contribute to many of these. Research investigating self-processing in healthy subjects has facilitated identiﬁcation of changes in speciﬁc neural circuits which may cause altered self-processing in psychiatric disorders. While there is evidence for altered self-processing in many psychiatric disorders, here we will focus on four of the most studied ones, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depression, and borderline personality disorder (BPD). We review evidence for dysfunction in two different neural systems implicated in self-processing, namely the cortical midline system (CMS) and the mirror neuron system (MNS), as well as contributions from altered inter-hemispheric connectivity (IHC). We conclude that while abnormalities in frontal-parietal activity and/or connectivity in the CMS are common to all four disorders there is more disruption of integration between frontal and parietal regions resulting in a shift toward parietal control in schizophrenia and ASD which may contribute to the greater severity and delusional aspects of their symptoms. Abnormalities in the MNS and in IHC are also particularly evident in schizophrenia and ASD and may lead to disturbances in sense of agency and the physical self in these two disorders. A better future understanding of how changes in the neural systems sub-serving self-processing contribute to different aspects of symptom abnormality in psychiatric disorders will require that more studies carry out detailed individual assessments of altered self-processing in conjunction with measurements of neural functioning.},

	abstract = {Research suggesting the beneﬁcial effects of yoga on myriad aspects of psychological health has proliferated in recent years, yet there is currently no overarching framework by which to understand yoga’s potential beneﬁcial effects. Here we provide a theoretical framework and systems-based network model of yoga that focuses on integration of top-down and bottom-up forms of self-regulation. We begin by contextualizing yoga in historical and contemporary settings, and then detail how speciﬁc components of yoga practice may affect cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and autonomic output under stress through an emphasis on interoception and bottom-up input, resulting in physical and psychological health. The model describes yoga practice as a comprehensive skillset of synergistic process tools that facilitate bidirectional feedback and integration between high- and low-level brain networks, and afferent and re-afferent input from interoceptive processes (somatosensory, viscerosensory, chemosensory). From a predictive coding perspective we propose a shift to perceptual inference for stress modulation and optimal self-regulation. We describe how the processes that sub-serve self-regulation become more automatized and efﬁcient over time and practice, requiring less effort to initiate when necessary and terminate more rapidly when no longer needed. To support our proposed model, we present the available evidence for yoga affecting self-regulatory pathways, integrating existing constructs from behavior theory and cognitive neuroscience with emerging yoga and meditation research. This paper is intended to guide future basic and clinical research, speciﬁcally targeting areas of development in the treatment of stress-mediated psychological disorders.},

	abstract = {Despite the success of available medical and psychosocial treatments, a sizable subgroup of individuals with commonly co-occurring disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), fail to make sufﬁcient treatment gains thereby prolonging their deﬁcits in life functioning and satisfaction. Clinically, these patients often display temperamental features reﬂecting heightened sensitivity to underlying motivational systems related to threat/safety and reward/loss (e.g., somatic anxiety) as well as inordinate negative self-referential processing (e.g., worry, rumination). This proﬁle may reﬂect disruption in two important neural networks associated with emotional/motivational salience (e.g., salience network) and self-referentiality (e.g., default network, DN). Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT) was developed to target this hypothesized proﬁle and its neurobehavioral markers. In the present study, 22 GAD patients (with and without MDD) completed resting state MRI scans before receiving 16 sessions of ERT. To test study these hypotheses, we examined the associations between baseline patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of the insula and of hubs within the DN (anterior and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex [MPFC] and posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]) and treatment-related changes in worry, somatic anxiety symptoms and decentering. Results suggest that greater treatment linked reductions in worry were associated with iFC clusters in both the insular and parietal cortices. Greater treatment linked gains in decentering, a metacognitive process that involves the capacity to observe items that arise in the mind with healthy psychological distance that is targeted by ERT, was associated with iFC clusters in the anterior and posterior DN. The current study adds to the growing body of research implicating disruptions in the default and salience networks as promising targets of treatment for GAD with and without co-occurring MDD.},

	abstract = {James (1890) distinguished two understandings of the self, the self as “Me” and the self as “I”. This distinction has recently regained popularity in cognitive science, especially in the context of experimental studies on the underpinnings of the phenomenal self. The goal of this paper is to take a step back from cognitive science and attempt to precisely distinguish between “Me” and “I” in the context of consciousness. This distinction was originally based on the idea that the former (“Me”) corresponds to the self as an object of experience (self as object), while the latter (“I”) reﬂects the self as a subject of experience (self as subject). I will argue that in most of the cases (arguably all) this distinction maps onto the distinction between the phenomenal self (reﬂecting self-related content of consciousness) and the metaphysical self (representing the problem of subjectivity of all conscious experience), and as such these two issues should be investigated separately using fundamentally different methodologies. Moreover, by referring to Metzinger’s (2018) theory of phenomenal self-models, I will argue that what is usually investigated as the phenomenal-“I” [following understanding of self-as-subject introduced by Wittgenstein (1958)] can be interpreted as object, rather than subject of experience, and as such can be understood as an element of the hierarchical structure of the phenomenal self-model. This understanding relates to recent predictive coding and free energy theories of the self and bodily self discussed in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy.},

Despite recent interest, it is still undetermined whether SSPs are all-ornothing or graded phenomena; whether they can be identiﬁed in neuroimaging data; and whether they can be altered through attentional training. These issues are approached through a neurophenomenological exploration of the sense-ofboundaries (SB), the fundamental experience of being an ‘I’ (self) separated from the ‘world’ (nonself). The SB experience was explored in collaboration with a uniquely qualiﬁed meditation practitioner, who volitionally produced, while being scanned by magnetoencephalogram (MEG), three mental states characterized by a graded SB experience. The results were then partly validated in an independent group of 10 long-term meditators. Implicated neural mechanisms include rightlateralized beta oscillations in the temporo-parietal junction, a region known to mediate the experiential unity of self and body; and in the medial parietal cortex, a central node of the self’s representational system. The graded nature as well as the trainable ﬂexibility and neural plasticity of SSPs may hold clinical implications for populations with a disturbed SB.},

	abstract = {The term “social cognition” can be construed in different ways. On the one hand, it can refer to the cognitive faculties involved in social activities, defined simply as situations where two or more individuals interact. On this view, social systems would consist of interactions between autonomous individuals; these interactions form higherlevel autonomous domains not reducible to individual actions. A contrasting, alternative view is based on a much stronger theoretical definition of a truly social domain, which is always defined by a set of structural norms; moreover, these social structures are not only a set of constraints, but actually constitute the possibility of enacting worlds that would just not exist without them. This view emphasises the heteronomy of individuals who abide by norms that are impersonal, culturally inherited and to a large extent independent of the individuals. Human beings are socialised through and through; consequently, all human cognition is social cognition. The article argues for this second position. Finally, it appears that fully blown autonomy actually requires heteronomy. It is the acceptance of the constraints of social structures that enables individuals to enter new realms of common meaningfulness. The emergence of social life marks a crucial step in the evolution of cognition; so that at some evolutionary point human cognition cannot but be social cognition.},

These theories often use the Kuhnian concepts of “paradigm” and “paradigm shift” for describing their ambitions and the current situation in cognitive science. I examine whether the use of Kuhn’s theory of science is appropriate here. There might be good reasons to think that cognitive science is in a situation of foundational crisis, but that does not entail that the classical paradigm (computationalism) is currently displaced to the beneﬁt of a new paradigm. Larry Laudan’s theory of research traditions is more enlightening than Kuhn’s theory for describing the scope and ambitions of radical views on cognition, and their relations with an anti-intellectualist tradition in philosophy.},

The main difference deals with the posited relations between reading, understanding, and material processes. Despite its anti-representationalist, externalist and anti-intellectualist core, enactivism continues to conceive cognition as supervenient on processes, whereas for Wittgenstein, the relations between psychological phenomena and concomitant processes are mediated by psychological concepts, behavioural criteria and normative practices.},

	abstract = {Objective: Evidence suggests that there is an association between chronic pain and disruption of the body schema. We tested the hypothesis in ﬁbromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Materials and Methods: We investigated distinct perceptual aspects of the body schema both in a sample of patients with FMS and in pain-free controls. Performances on the left/right judgment task were measured; tactile acuity was assessed by using the 2-point discrimination test. Furthermore, we evaluated sensations evoked by tactile stimulation with von Frey ﬁlaments to body parts that were experiencing pain. Anomalous sensations elicited by sensorymotor conﬂict (SMC) were also investigated.
Results: Patients with FMS showed inferior performance on the right/left judgment task, both in terms of correct matches (75.38\% vs. 89.67\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05) and response time (2.58 s vs. 1.89 s, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). Effect sizes were large and very large, respectively. Two-point discrimination thresholds were signiﬁcantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in participants from the FMS sample (mean of 49.71 mm, SD: 12.09 mm) relative to controls (mean of 37.36 mm, SD: 7.81 mm). Nine of 14 participants with FMS, but no control participants, reported referred sensations upon tactile stimulation, including tingling, pins and needles, weight, and cramps. Referral sites included regions both adjacent and remote to stimulated sites. Patients with FMS scored across all items within the administered questionnaire addressing anomalous sensations on the mirror setup (Cohen d = 1.04 to 2.42 across all items), and FMS patients perceived pain during the SMC (the required statistical power for it to be statistically signiﬁcant was 96\% and for it to be recognized as a difference of means in pain item).
Conclusion: Our present ﬁndings suggest a disrupted body schema and propensity to experiencing anomalous somatosensory sensations during SMC in people with FMS.},

It is often assumed that these two processes, thinking about self and thinking about others, are pitted against each other when adolescents engage in social decision making such as giving or sharing. Recent evidence from social neuroscience, however, does not support this notion of conflicting motives, suggesting instead that thinking about self and others relies on a common network of social-affective brain regions, with the medial prefrontal cortex playing a central role in the integration of perspectives related to self and others. Here, we argue that self- and other-oriented thinking are intertwined processes that rely on an overlapping neural network. Adolescents’ motivation to contribute to society can be fostered most when self- and other-oriented motives align.},

	abstract = {Reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), recently reclassiﬁed as a complex regional pain syndrome, type I (CRPS- I), is best known for its disabling sensory symptoms, including pain, allodynia, and abnormal skin temperature. Yet, motor dysfunction is common in CRPS and can result in major disability. In addition to weakness of the involved limb, CRPS patients may develop symptoms akin to a neurological neglect-like syndrome, whereby the limb may feel foreign (“cognitive neglect”) and directed mental and visual attention is needed to move the limb (“motor neglect”). Members of the patient support group, the Reﬂex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association (RSDSA), were mailed a questionnaire inserted in their newsletter which inquired about the presence of these neglect-like symptoms; in addition, a separate medical history questionnaire was included to assess adequate documentation for the diagnosis of CRPS. A total of 242 patients returned the questionnaire but only 224 of the questionnaires were analyzed; 15 were excluded due to inadequate documentation of CRPS and 3 were excluded due to non-limb involvement. Eighty-four percent (84\%) of these respondents endorsed the presence of at least one neglect symptom and 47\% indicated they had both “cognitive” and “motor” neglect symptoms. Of interest, approximately 33\% of respondents spontaneously wrote comments regarding the signiﬁcant disability due to these neglect symptoms and the difﬁculty explaining these unusual symptoms to their health care providers and family. This patient survey conﬁrms the presence of neglect-like symptoms in a subset of CRPS patients. Neglect-like symptoms need to be addressed and validated by health care providers.

So-called ‘neglect-like’ symptoms have been reported in CRPS, however no studies have yet analyzed this phenomenon which might substantiate the theory of the central nervous system involvement in the pathophysiology of CRPS. A total of 114 patients with CRPS of the upper limb underwent bedside neurological examination. ‘Neglect-like’ symptoms were determined by asking all patients what kind of feeling they had toward the affected hand (feeling of foreignness). Hemispatial neglect was tested with the line bisection task in 29 patients and sensory extinction to simultaneous stimulation in 40 patients. The ability to identify ﬁngers after tactile stimulation was tested in 73 patients. Independently of the affected side and disease duration, 54.4\% of the patients reported that their hand felt ‘foreign’ or ‘strange’. The ability to identify ﬁngers was impaired in 48\% on the affected hand and in 6.5\% on the unaffected hand (X2 ¼ 33:52; df ¼ 1; p , 0:0001). These ﬁndings were related to pain intensity, illness duration and the extent of sensory deﬁcits. No typical abnormalities indicating neglect were found in the line bisection test. Sensory extinction was normal in all patients. A large proportion of CRPS patients have disturbances of the self-perception of the hand, indicating an alteration of higher central nervous system processing. There are no indicators that classic neglect or extinction contribute to these ﬁndings. Physical therapy of such patients should take this observation into consideration.},

	abstract = {Tai Chi (TC) is a slow-motion contemplative exercise that is associated with improvements in sensorimotor measures, including decreased force variability, enhanced tactile acuity, and improved proprioception, especially in elderly populations. Here, we carried out two studies evaluating the effect of TC practice on measures associated with sensorimotor processing. In study 1, we evaluated TC’s effects on an oscillatory parameter associated with motor function, beta rhythm (15–30 Hz) coherence, focusing speciﬁcally on beta rhythm intermuscular coherence (IMC), which is tightly coupled to beta corticomuscular coherence (CMC). We utilized electromyography (EMG) to compare beta IMC in older TC practitioners with age-matched controls, as well as novices with advanced TC practitioners. Given previous ﬁndings of elevated, maladaptive beta coherence in older subjects, we hypothesized that increased TC practice would be associated with a monotonic decrease in beta IMC, but rather discovered that novice practitioners manifested higher beta IMC than both controls and advanced practitioners, forming an inverted U-shaped practice curve. This ﬁnding suggests that TC practice elicits complex changes in sensory and motor processes over the developmental lifespan of TC training. In study 2, we focused on somatosensory (e.g., tactile and proprioceptive) responses to the rubber hand illusion (RHI) in a middle-aged TC group, assessing whether responses to the illusion became dampened with greater cumulative practice. As hypothesized, TC practice was associated with decreased likelihood to misattribute tactile stimulation during the RHI to the rubber hand, although there was no effect of TC practice on measures of proprioception or on subjective reports of ownership. These studies provide preliminary evidence that TC practice both modulates beta network coherence in a non-linear fashion, perhaps as a result of the focus on not only efferent motor but also afferent sensory activity, and alters tactile sensations during the RHI. This work is the ﬁrst to show the effects of TC on low level sensorimotor processing and integrated body awareness, and this multi-scale ﬁnding may help to provide a mechanistic explanation for the widespread sensorimotor beneﬁts observed with TC practice in symptoms associated with aging and difﬁcult illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {Introspection, or metacognition, is the capacity to reﬂect on our own thoughts and behaviours. Here, we investigated how one speciﬁc metacognitive ability (the relationship between task performance and conﬁdence) develops in adolescence, a period of life associated with the emergence of self-concept and enhanced self-awareness. We employed a task that dissociates objective performance on a visual task from metacognitive ability in a group of 56 participants aged between 11 and 41 years. Metacognitive ability improved signiﬁcantly with age during adolescence, was highest in late adolescence and plateaued going into adulthood. Our results suggest that awareness of one’s own perceptual decisions shows a prolonged developmental trajectory during adolescence.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we examined the relationship between developmental modulation of socioaffective brain systems and adolescents’ preoccupation with social evaluation. Child, adolescent, and adult participants viewed cues indicating that a camera was alternately off, warming up, or projecting their image to a peer during the acquisition of behavioral-, autonomic-, and neural-response (functional MRI) data. Believing that a peer was actively watching them was sufficient to induce self-conscious emotion that was stronger in adolescents than in children and adults. Autonomic arousal was uniquely heightened in adolescents. These behavioral patterns were paralleled by emergent engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and striatum-MPFC connectivity during adolescence, which are thought to promote adolescent-motivated social behavior. These findings demonstrate that adolescents’ self-consciousness is related to agedependent sensitivity of brain systems critical to socioaffective processes. Further, unique interactions between the MPFC and striatum may provide a mechanism by which socialevaluation contexts influence adolescent behavior.},

	abstract = {Alteration in self-perception is a salient feature in major depression. Hyperactivity of anterior cortical midline regions has been implicated in this phenomenon in depressed adults. Here, we extend this work to depressed adolescents during a developmental time when neuronal circuitry underlying the sense of self matures by using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and connectivity analyses. Twenty-three depressed adolescents and 18 healthy controls (HC) viewed positive and negative trait words in a scanner and judged whether each word described them (‘self’ condition) or was a good trait to have (‘general’ condition). Self-perception scores were based on participants’ endorsements of positive and negative traits during the fMRI task. Depressed adolescents exhibited more negative self-perceptions than HC. Both groups activated cortical midline regions in response to self-judgments compared to general-judgments. However, depressed adolescents recruited the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus more for positive self-judgments. Additionally, local connectivity of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex was reduced during self-reﬂection in depressed adolescents. Our ﬁndings highlight differences in self-referential processing network function between depressed and healthy adolescents and support the need for further investigation of brain mechanisms associated with the self, as they may be paramount to understanding the etiology and development of major depressive disorder.},

The goals of this study were to investigate the contribution of these regions to self-evaluations in late childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, and to examine whether these differed per domain (academic, physical and prosocial) and valence (positive versus negative). Also, we tested whether this activation changes across adolescence. For this purpose, participants between ages 11–21-years (N = 150) evaluated themselves on trait sentences in an fMRI session. Behaviorally, adolescents rated their academic traits less positively than children and young adults. The neural analyses showed that evaluating self-traits versus a control condition was associated with increased activity in mPFC (domain-general effect), and positive traits were associated with increased activity in ventral mPFC (valence effect). Self-related mPFC activation increased linearly with age, but only for evaluating physical traits. Furthermore, an adolescent-specific decrease in striatum activation for positive self traits was found. Finally, we found domain-specific neural activity for evaluating traits in physical (dorsolateral PFC, dorsal mPFC) and academic (PPC) domains. Together, these results highlight the importance of domain distinctions when studying self-concept development in late childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.},

	abstract = {Purpose  While several meta-analyses and reviews revealed a worse body image disturbance (BID) in adults with anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia nervosa (BN) than in controls, no systematic evidence is available on BID in children and adolescents. Since the usual onset of AN and BN is before the age of 21 years, being aware of BID in children and adolescents is crucial for preventing and treating eating disorders. This systematic review aims to provide an initial overview of differences in the BID components perception, global subjective satisfaction, affect/cognition, and behavior between children and adolescents with AN and BN and healthy controls.
Methods  We conducted a systematic data search in PubMed and PsycINFO based on a priori eligibility criteria (AN or BN group; gender-matched healthy control group; each group n ≥ 20; maximum age 19 years; BID outcome compared between groups; published in English or German).
Results  We were able to include k = 8 records. Compared to healthy controls, children and adolescents with AN and BN scored higher in the BID components perception, global subjective satisfaction, affect/cognition, and behavior.
Conclusions  As previously found in adults, BID in children and adolescents is associated with AN and BN. Interventions and treatments are needed to alleviate BID in children and adolescents with BN and AN. We also noted that we need more investigations on BID differences in children and adolescents to improve the database.},

He develops then the various clinical forms of “pathological cognitive dysharmonias”: total delays of cognitive development, dyspraxia, dysgnosia and hyperkinetic dyschronia, illustrated by several instantaneous private clinics. He shows then that these anomalies, far from being exceptional, on the contrary are often ignored, although banal in “behavioural problems”. He presents then the psychopathological theoretical assumptions the best capable ones to give an account of these symptoms and to implement the suitable treatment.},

Method: Four hundred and seventy Australian girls (13À17 years old) completed measures of teasing history, body dissatisfaction, global psychological functioning, dietary restraint, and bulimic behaviors. They were also measured in order to compute body mass index (BMI). CSM techniques were used to analyze the relationships between these latent variables. Two a priori models were tested, one was selected, and post-hoc model-®tting was undertaken. Results: The ®nal model indicated that BMI directly in¯uenced teasing, which directly in¯uenced body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction in¯uenced both global psychological functioning and restriction, whereas restriction had a direct in¯uence on bulimia. Global psychological functioning also had a direct in¯uence on bulimia. Discussion: The results support previous research indicating that teasing and body dissatisfaction are risk factors for the development of eating disturbances. Ó 2002 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Actually, there are lot of questions for psychoanalysis and neurosciences. Even if sometimes these two theories seem to be distant, and even if some questions are too different to be worked in the same way, some of them can be discussed by these two approaches. It certainly does not make sense to try to ﬁnd a consensus between psychoanalysis and neurosciences: it’s a real risk because, in this case, they’ll probably lose their speciﬁcity. But, even if differences and oppositions exist, there are some similar questions, which are related to both ﬁelds of research. Some concepts used by Freud are evoked in neurosciences. And, even if they afﬁrm their differences with the creator of the psychoanalysis, neuroscientists speak about him and underline that he found out a lot of concepts still useful today. To build the unconscious in psychoanalysis, Freud needed different concepts. Some have fallen into disuse but through current discoveries in neuroscience, these notions, which are sometimes old but still fundamental in Freudian logic, can again be questioned. This is the case of perception. This phenomenon studied by Freud from its ﬁrst researches (since 1896), is, in neuroscience, a very important support of experiences: many researches aim to understand the operations in cerebral treatment of information. And the ﬁrst ﬁlters are the perceptions. They are a vector of very dynamic researches about the unconscious or, more precisely, about what it should be named ‘‘cognitive unconscious’’. But even if we have to establish the difference between Freudian unconscious and cognitive unconscious, the notion of perception really becomes a possible support for a dialectic exchange between psychoanalysis and neuroscience about the unconscious, but more speciﬁcally about subjectivity.},

	abstract = {Perceived body size is a fundamental construct that reflects our knowledge of self and is important for all aspects of perception, yet how we perceive our bodies and how the body is represented in the brain is not yet fully understood. In order to understand how the brain perceives and represents the body, we need an objective method that is not vulnerable to affective or cognitive influences. Here, we achieve this by assessing the accuracy of full-body size perception using a novel psychophysical method that taps into the implicit body representation for determining perceived size. Participants were tested with life-size images of their body as seen from different viewpoints with the expectation that greater distortions would occur for unfamiliar views. The Body Shape Questionnaire was also administered. Using a two-alternative forced choice design, participants were sequentially shown two life-size images of their whole body dressed in a standardized tight-fitting outfit seen from the front, side, or back. In one image, the aspect ratio (with the horizontal or vertical dimension fixed) was varied using an adaptive staircase, while the other was undistorted. Participants reported which image most closely matched their own body size. The staircase honed in on the distorted image that was equally likely as the undistorted photo to be judged as matching their perception of themselves. From this, the perceived size of their internal body representation could be calculated. Underestimation of body width was found when the body was viewed from the front or back in both sexes. However, females, but not males, overestimated their width when the body was viewed from the side. Height was perceived accurately in all views. These findings reveal distortions in perceived size for healthy populations and show that both viewpoint and sex matter for the implicit body representation. Though the back view of one’s body is rarely–if ever–seen, perceptual distortions were the same as for the front view. This provides insight into how the brain might construct its representation of three-dimensional body shape.},

	abstract = {One key symptom of anorexia nervosa (AN) is body image distortion (BID). For example, AN patients who are asked to perform body size estimation tasks tend to overestimate their body size; this is thought to indicate a distortion of the perceptive component of body image. Although BID is an important treatment objective, only few treatment approaches explicitly target body image, and even fewer target the perceptive component. Moreover, very little is known about how patients’ perceptive body image changes after treatment and related weight gain. Consequently, we investigated changes of the perceptive BID in adolescent AN patients at the beginning (T1) and the end (T2) of inpatient treatment using a body size estimation task. A total of 38 AN patients performed the test for Body Image Distortion in Children and Adolescents (BID-CA) within the first 2 weeks of inpatient treatment and at the end of treatment. The results were compared to 48 healthy control (HC) participants performing the same task once. At T1, AN patients overestimated their body size more than HC, i.e., a total overestimation of 33\% in AN patients vs. 11\% in HC. At T2, AN patients overestimated their arm size to the same degree that they did at TI, but overestimations for the thigh and waist were reduced, and their overestimations for the waist no longer differed from the HC group. Thus, after treatment, AN patients were partly able to more realistically estimate their body size. Several factors may have influenced the observed changes in body size estimation, including task repetition, deliberate adjustment, growing into their preexisting perceptive body image through weight gain, as well as targeted and non-specific psychotherapeutic treatments. In conclusion, the perceptive BID in adolescent AN patients is persistent but also modifiable. Although diverse factors presumably play a role in changing BID, these findings suggest that AN patients may benefit from targeted treatment of BID.},

	abstract = {Background: As children approach adolescence, they focus increasingly on their appearance and physical attraction due to teenage body-image. Teaching the concepts of adolescent health changes an individual’s attitudes towards parts of the body. The health belief model (HBM) is one of the significant pedagogic models in health education. According to this model, the individual’s decision and motivation for adopting healthy behaviors depends on three separate categories “personal perception, adaptive behaviors, and probability of performing that action or behavior”. This study investigated the effect of teaching puberty health concepts on the basis of a HBM on perceived body image in female adolescents.
Methods: A quasi-experimental research design was used in the study. This study was conducted with 60 sixth grade girls in state elementary schools in Yazd, Iran, that were selected with cluster sampling method and assigned randomly into experimental and control groups. The experimental group were educated in the school during eight 45-min sessions based on the HBM, whereas the control group were educated using the traditional lecturing method. The data were collected with demographic and self-body image questionnaires completed before and after intervention. The data were analyzed with SPSS16 using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
Results: The mean age of the participants was 12.16 ± 0.74 years. The findings showed that “perceived body image” and “students’ self-attitude” improved significantly after intervention; yet, no significant difference was found between the subscales “attitudes towards weight” and “satisfaction with various parts of the body”.
Conclusion: The results of the study confirmed the efficacy and efficiency of teaching puberty health on the basis of the HBM on improving perceived body image in female adolescents.},

	abstract = {Body image disturbance is an important feature of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Some researchers have argued that body image disturbance is not just a symptom of AN, but plays a causal role in the development, persistence, and relapse of AN. Our aim was to systematically review the existing empirical evidence concerning the role of the cognitive-affective, perceptual, and behavioral components of body image disturbance in AN. 46 studies fulfilled eligibility criteria reporting about 4928 participants with AN. There is some evidence suggesting that body image disturbance is related to the course of AN. However, experimental studies were missing and operationalizations of body image constructs and AN outcome measures varied greatly across studies. Therefore, on the basis of the available empirical data, it remained unclear whether body image disturbance is indeed a causal risk factor for AN. For future studies, it is crucial to use more consistent terminology and more specific and precise definitions of body image constructs as well as experimental designs, adequately powered samples, and well-validated measures. Altogether, this would set the stage to generate the high-quality data that are necessary to clarify the role of body image disturbance in the onset, maintenance and relapse of AN.},

Naguère redoutable paradoxe qu’une science sérieuse abandonnait volontiers aux philosophes, la conscience a-t-elle été ramenée finalement à la condition d’un objet de science parmi les autres? Le développement d’une nouvelle «neuroscience de la conscience» depuis une vingtaine d’années est souvent présenté comme une avancée naturelle pour une science forte de son succès dans l’explication des fonctions cognitives sur la base des mécanismes neuronaux du cerveau humain. Conçue, elle aussi, originairement, comme «science de la conscience», mais sur la base de l’immanence du sujet conscient à sa propre expérience vécue, la phénoménologie doit-elle réfréner son sens du paradoxe devant le projet de cette neuroscience de la conscience, pour ne pas être accusée d’irrationalisme? Faisant retour sur le dialogue Changeux-Ricœur, je relève les objections du phénoménologue à l’objectivation de notre expérience de la conscience sur la base de mécanismes corrélatifs dans le cerveau et j’examine sur l’exemple représentatif de la théorie neuronale de Changeux, Dehaene et al. dans quelle mesure cette critique phénoménologique garde une pertinence.

Paradoxo a pouco tempo temido de que uma ciência séria se entrega de bom grado aos filósofos, será que a consciência foi finalmente reduzida à condição de um objeto da ciência, dentre os demais? O desenvolvimento de uma nova “neurociência da consciência” por cerca de vinte anos é frequentemente apresentado como um avanço natural para uma ciência segura de seu sucesso na explicação de funções cognitivas baseadas nos mecanismos neurais do cérebro humano. Concebida, também, originalmente como uma “ciência da consciência”, mas com base na imanência do sujeito consciente à sua própria experiência vivida, a fenomenologia deve refrear seu sentido de paradoxo frente ao projeto da neurociência da consciência, para não ser acusada de irracionalismo? Retornando ao diálogo Changeux-Ricoeur, considero a crítica da objetivação fenomenológica da nossa experiência de consciência com base em mecanismos internos ao cérebro, e examino o exemplo representativo da teoria neuronal de Changeux e Dehaene et al., para avaliar até que ponto a crítica fenomenológica permanece relevante.},

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology’s lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and largeN designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

	abstract = {Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy, perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily inﬂuenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive science—classic symbolic architectures, statistical ⁄ dynamical systems, and grounded cognition—will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.},

We created a virtual representation of the internal image participants had of their own body shape. We also created a virtual body corresponding to the internal representation they had of their ideal body shape, and we built another virtual body based on their real body measures. Participants saw the three different virtual bodies from an embodied ﬁrst-person perspective and from a third-person perspective and had to evaluate the appearance of those virtual bodies. We observed that female participants evaluated their real body as more attractive when they saw it from a third-person perspective, and that their level of body dissatisfaction was lower after the experimental procedure. We believe that third-person perspective allowed female participants to perceive their real body shape without applying the negative prior beliefs usually associated to the “self”, and that this resulted in a more positive evaluation of their body shape. We speculate that this method could be applied with patients suffering from eating disorders, by making their body perception more realistic and therefore improve their body satisfaction.},

Here we show that visuotactile congruency indeed does not add to already high measures for body ownership on explicit measures, but does modulate movement behavior when walking in the laboratory. Speciﬁcally, participants who took ownership over a more corpulent virtual body with intact visuo-tactile congruency increased safety distances towards the laboratory’s walls compared to participants who experienced the same illusion with deteriorated visuo-tactile congruency. This eﬀect is in line with the body schema more readily adapting to a more corpulent body after receiving congruent tactile information. We conclude that the action-oriented, unconscious body schema relies more heavily on tactile information compared to more explicit aspects of body ownership.},

	abstract = {Incorporating the fact that the senses are embodied is necessary for an organism to interpret sensory information. Before a unified perception of the world can be formed, sensory signals must be processed with reference to body representation. The various attributes of the body such as shape, proportion, posture, and movement can be both derived from the various sensory systems and can affect perception of the world (including the body itself). In this review we examine the relationships between sensory and motor information, body representations, and perceptions of the world and the body. We provide several examples of how the body affects perception (including but not limited to body perception). First we show that body orientation effects visual distance perception and object orientation. Also, visual-auditory crossmodal-correspondences depend on the orientation of the body: audio “high” frequencies correspond to a visual “up” defined by both gravity and body coordinates. Next, we show that perceived locations of touch is affected by the orientation of the head and eyes on the body, suggesting a visual component to coding body locations. Additionally, the reference-frame used for coding touch locations seems to depend on whether gaze is static or moved relative to the body during the tactile task. The perceived attributes of the body such as body size, affect tactile perception even at the level of detection thresholds and two-point discrimination. Next, long-range tactile masking provides clues to the posture of the body in a canonical body schema. Finally, ownership of seen body parts depends on the orientation and perspective of the body part in view. Together, all of these findings demonstrate how sensory and motor information, body representations, and perceptions (of the body and the world) are interdependent.},

	abstract = {We studied how the integration of seen and felt tactile stimulation modulates somatosensory processing, and investigated whether visuotactile integration depends on temporal contiguity of stimulation, and its coherence with a pre-existing body representation. During training, participants viewed a rubber hand or a rubber object that was tapped either synchronously with stimulation of their own hand, or in an uncorrelated fashion. In a subsequent test phase, somatosensory ERPs were recorded to tactile stimulation of the left or right hand, to assess how tactile processing was affected by previous visuotactile experience during training. An enhanced somatosensory N140 component was elicited after synchronous, compared with uncorrelated, visuotactile training, irrespective of whether participants viewed a rubber hand or rubber object. This early effect of visuotactile integration on somatosensory processing is interpreted as a candidate electrophysiological correlate of the rubber hand illusion that is determined by temporal contiguity, but not by pre-existing body representations. ERP modulations were observed beyond 200ms post-stimulus, suggesting an attentional bias induced by visuotactile training. These late modulations were absent when the stimulation of a rubber hand and participants' own hand was uncorrelated during training, suggesting that pre-existing body representations may affect later stages of tactile processing.},

	abstract = {Episodic memories (EMs) are recollections of contextually rich and personally relevant past events. EM has been linked to the sense of self, allowing one to mentally travel back in subjective time and re-experience past events. However, the sense of self has recently been linked to online multisensory processing and bodily self-consciousness (BSC). It is currently unknown whether EM depends on BSC mechanisms. Here, we used a new immersive virtual reality (VR) system that maintained the perceptual richness of life episodes and fully controlled the experimental stimuli during encoding and retrieval, including the participant’s body. Our data reveal a classical EM finding, which shows that memory for complex real-life like scenes decays over time. However, here we also report a novel finding that delayed retrieval performance can be enhanced when participants view their body as part of the virtual scene during encoding. This body effect was not observed when no virtual body or a moving control object was shown, thereby linking the sense of self, and BSC in particular, to EMs. The present VR methodology and the present behavioral findings will enable to study key aspects of EM in healthy participants and may be especially beneficial for the restoration of self-relevant memories in future experiments.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Distorted representations of the body are observed in healthy individuals as well as in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Distortions of the body model have been attributed to the somatotopic cerebral representation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that visual biases also contribute to those distortions. To better understand the sources of such distortions, we compared the metric representations across five body parts affording different degrees of tactile sensitivity and visual accessibility. We evaluated their perceived dimensions using a Line Length Judgment task. We found that most body parts were underestimated in their dimensions. The estimation error relative to their length was predicted by their tactile acuity, supporting the influence of the cortical somatotopy on the body model. However, tactile acuity did not explain the distortions observed for the width. Visual accessibility in turn does appear to mediate body distortions, as we observed that the dimensions of the dorsal portion of the neck were the only ones accurately perceived. Coherent with the multisensory nature of body representations, we argue that the perceived dimensions of body parts are estimated by integrating visual and somatosensory information, each weighted differently, based on their availability for a given body part and a given spatial dimension.},

These two visual functions develop at similar rates and have nearly the same absolute values between 1 month and 6 years of age. After age 6, grating acuity is constant at the adult level, but vernier acuity continues to improve, becoming a hyperacuity. Vernier acuity reaches asymptotic levels around age 14 years. These results suggest that adultlike vernier hyperacuity is not limited by spatial resolution or sensitivity of small receptive ﬁelds, but rather that the limitation is imposed by higher-level processing. Sensitivity, connections in visual cortical areas, or both therefore retain plasticity throughout childhood and into adolescence.},

	abstract = {Tactile acuity is known to decline with age in adults, possibly as the result of receptor loss, but less is understood about how tactile acuity changes during childhood. Previous research from our laboratory has shown that fingertip size influences tactile spatial acuity in young adults: those with larger fingers tend to have poorer acuity, possibly because mechanoreceptors are more sparsely distributed in larger fingers. We hypothesized that a similar relationship would hold among children. If so, children’s tactile spatial acuity might be expected to worsen as their fingertips grow. However, concomitant CNS maturation might result in more efficient perceptual processing, counteracting the effect of fingertip growth on tactile acuity. To investigate, we conducted a cross-sectional study, testing 116 participants ranging in age from 6 to 16 years on a precision-controlled tactile grating orientation task. We measured each participant's grating orientation threshold on the dominant index finger, along with physical properties of the fingertip: surface area, volume, sweat pore spacing, and temperature. We found that, as in adults, children with larger fingertips (at a given age) had significantly poorer acuity, yet paradoxically acuity did not worsen significantly with age. We propose that finger growth during development results in a gradual decline in innervation density as receptive fields reposition to cover an expanding skin surface. At the same time, central maturation presumably enhances perceptual processing.},

We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain responses to soft brush stroking of both glabrous (palm) and hairy (forearm) skin in healthy children (5–13 years), adolescents (14–17 years), and adults (25–35 years). Adult-deﬁned regions-of-interests in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), insular cortex and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) were signiﬁcantly and similarly activated in all age groups. Whole-brain analyses revealed that responses in the ipsilateral SII were positively correlated with age in both genders, and that responses in bilateral regions near the pSTS correlated signiﬁcantly and strongly with age in females but not in males. These results suggest that brain mechanisms associated with both sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational aspects of touch are largely established in school-aged children, and that there is a general continuing maturation of SII and a female-speciﬁc increase in pSTS sensitivity with age. Our work establishes a groundwork for future comparative studies of tactile processing in developmental disorders characterized by disrupted social perception such as autism.},

The positive affective component of touch is thought to be conveyed via a group of unmyelinated, low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents, known as C-tactile fibers that are optimally activated by gentle, slow, stroking touch. Touch targeting these C-tactile fibers has been shown to decrease the heart rate in infants. The current study investigated the relationship between age and psychophysical ratings in response to affective touch. A total of n = 43 participants (early childhood: aged 5–8 years, 9 girls, 12 boys; late childhood: aged 9–12 years, 12 girls, 10 boys) were presented with C-tactile optimal and sub-optimal stroking velocities and rated touch pleasantness on an affective pictorial scale. For both age groups, we found that children preferred Ctactile-targeted stimulation. A comparison with previously published data showed that the children’s preference for C-tactile-targeted stimulation was similar to those obtained in adolescents and adults. We speculate that the effect of C-tactile-targeted touch, which is linked with pleasantness, shapes the children’s preference for C-tactile over non-C-tactile-targeted stimulation, and that C-tactile afferent stimulation is important for social development.},

In adults, these functions are driven by different, neuroanatomically and functionally segregated fibres. To date, very little is known about the basic features of these fibres in childhood and this lack of knowledge is mirrored in the affective touch domain, where there are no studies on the main physiological features of the tactile processes linked to the stimulation of the hairy skin, namely the preferential site of affective touch. Thus, our study aims to analyze (1) tactile sensitivity and tactile acuity of children’s hairy forearms; (2) a possible dissociation between somatosensation and the affective touch; and (3) the presence/absence of the perception of affective touch already in childhood. To these aims, participants (160 children, aged 6 to 14 years), were administered with the Von Frey (tactile sensitivity) and the 2 Point Discrimination (tactile acuity) tests. Affective touch was measured following the classic protocol and pleasantness ratings were recorded. Our findings showed a correlation between age and somatosensation, suggesting a progressive reduction of sensitivity and acuity as age grows. Further, there was no overlap between affective touch and somatosensation, suggesting a behavioural segregation. Lastly, we found higher pleasantness ratings for Affective versus Neutral stimulations at all ages and an enhanced preference for Affective as age grows. We concluded that both somatosensation and affective touch are already present as two separate components of touch in childhood and change as a function of age.},

	abstract = {This study was aimed to examine if adolescent obesity is associated with alterations of insula function as indexed by differential correlations between insula activation and perception of interoceptive feedback versus external food cues. We hypothesized that, in healthy weight adolescents, insula activation will positively correlate with interoceptive sensitivity, whereas in excess weight adolescents, insula activation will positively correlate with sensitivity towards external cues. Fifty-four adolescents (age range 12–18), classiﬁed in two groups as a function of BMI, excess weight (n = 22) and healthy weight (n = 32), performed the Risky-Gains task (sensitive to insula function) inside an fMRI scanner, and completed the heartbeat perception task (measuring interoceptive sensitivity) and the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (measuring external eating as well as emotional eating and restraint) outside the scanner. We found that insula activation during the Risky-Gains task positively correlated with interoceptive sensitivity and negatively correlated with external eating in healthy weight adolescents. Conversely, in excess weight adolescents, insula activation positively correlated with external eating and negatively correlated with interoceptive sensitivity, arguably reﬂecting obesity related neurocognitive adaptations. In excess weight adolescents, external eating was also positively associated with caudate nucleus activation, and restrained eating was negatively associated with insula activation. Our ﬁndings suggest that adolescent obesity is associated with disrupted tuning of the insula system towards interoceptive input.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the possible causal link between alexithymia and the emergence of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as alcohol consumption in a sample of late adolescents.
Method: The nonclinical sample comprised late adolescents (n=315), including both females (n=256) and males (n=59). The follow-up period was 4 years, and at baseline, the mean age of the subjects was 19 years (range 17−21 years). Alexithymia was measured with the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), depression symptoms with the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory (RBDI), anxiety with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and alcohol consumption with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT). The three TAS-20 subscales were assessed separately. Linear and cumulative logistic regression analyses were used for the evaluation of associations, and the analyses were adjusted with the corresponding baseline scores.
Results: The TAS-20 total and subscale scores did not predict the RBDI or AUDIT scores at follow-up. However, the TAS-20 subscale “difﬁculty identifying feelings” was signiﬁcantly associated with both STAI-State (P=.007) and STAI-Trait (P=.004) scores at follow-up.
Conclusions: Alexithymic features may be individual predictors of later anxiety symptoms. The signiﬁcant differences between the various dimensions of alexithymia should be considered in future studies. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Tactile interactions with our environment stimulate afferent ﬁbers within the skin, which deliver information about sensations of pain, texture, itch and other feelings to the brain as a comprehensive sense of self. These tactile interactions can stimulate brain regions involved in interoception and reward processing. This study examined subjective, behavioral, and neural processing as a function of age during stimulation of A-beta (Aβ) and C tactile (CT) afferents using a soft brush stroke task. 16 adolescents (ages 15–17), 22 young adults (ages 20–28), and 20 mature adults (ages 29–55) underwent a simple continuous performance task while periodically anticipating and experiencing a soft touch to the palm or forearm, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI results showed that adolescents displayed greater bilateral posterior insula activation than young and mature adults across all conditions and stimulus types. Adolescents also demonstrated greater bilateral posterior insula activation than young and mature adults speciﬁcally in response to the soft touch condition. Adolescents also exhibited greater activation than mature adults in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and striatum during the soft touch condition. However, mature adults showed greater striatum activation than adolescents and young adults during anticipation. In the left anterior cingulate cortex, mature adults exhibited greater activation than adolescents and young adults when anticipating the upcoming touch. These results support the hypothesis that adolescents show an exaggerated neural response to pleasant stimulation of afferents, which may have profound effects on how they approach or avoid social and risky situations. In particular, heightened interoceptive reactivity to pleasant stimuli might cause adolescents to seek experiences that are associated with pleasant stimulation.},

	abstract = {Interoception refers to the perception of the physiological condition of the body, including hunger, temperature, and heart rate. There is a growing appreciation that interoception is integral to higher-order cognition. Indeed, existing research indicates an association between low interoceptive sensitivity and alexithymia (a difﬁculty identifying one’s own emotion), underscoring the link between bodily and emotional awareness. Despite this appreciation, the developmental trajectory of interoception across the lifespan remains under-researched, with clear gaps in our understanding. This qualitative review and opinion paper provides a brief overview of interoception, discussing its relevance for developmental psychopathology, and highlighting measurement issues, before surveying the available work on interoception across four stages of development: infancy, childhood, adolescence and late adulthood. Where gaps in the literature addressing the development of interoception exist, we draw upon the association between alexithymia and interoception, using alexithymia as a possible marker of atypical interoception. Evidence indicates that interoceptive ability varies across development, and that this variance correlates with established age-related changes in cognition and with risk periods for the development of psychopathology. We suggest a theory within which atypical interoception underlies the onset of psychopathology and risky behaviour in adolescence, and the decreased socio-emotional competence observed in late adulthood.},

	abstract = {Objects comprise of visual and auditory signatures that arrive through distinct sensory channels. Exposure to cross-modal events sets up expectations about what a given object most likely ”sounds” like, and vice versa, thereby facilitating detection and recognition. Whereas episodic and working memory functions decline with age, the extent to which multisensory integration processes change with age remains an open question. In the present study, we examined whether multisensory integration processes play a compensatory role in normal aging. Magnetoencephalography recordings of semantically-related cross-modal and unimodal auditory and visual stimuli captured the spatiotemporal dynamics of multisensory responses in young and older adults. Whereas sensory-specific regions showed increased activity in response to cross-modal compared to unimodal stimuli 100 ms after stimulus onset in both age groups, posterior parietal and medial prefrontal regions responded preferentially to cross-modal stimuli between 150 and 300 ms in the older group only. Additionally, faster detection of cross-modal stimuli correlated with increased activity in inferior parietal and medial prefrontal regions 100 ms after stimulus onset in older compared to younger adults. Age-related differences in visual dominance were also observed with older adults exhibiting significantly larger multisensory facilitation effects relative to the auditory modality. Using structural equation modeling, we showed that age-related increases in parietal and medial prefrontal source activity predicted faster detection of cross-modal stimuli. Furthermore, the relationship between performance and source activity was mediated by age-related reductions in gray matter volume in those regions. Thus, we propose that multisensory integration processes change with age such that posterior parietal and medial prefrontal activity underlies the integrated response in older adults.},

Here we review the current literature in order to develop a framework for understanding how the vestibular system contributes to body representation. According to recent models, we distinguish between three processes for body representation, and we look at whether vestibular signals might inﬂuence each process. These are (i) somatosensation, the primary sensory processing of somatic stimuli, (ii) somatoperception, the processes of constructing percepts and experiences of somatic objects and events and (iii) somatorepresentation, the knowledge about the body as a physical object in the world. Vestibular signals appear to contribute to all three levels in this model of body processing. Thus, the traditional view of the vestibular system as a low-level, dedicated orienting module tends to underestimate the pervasive role of vestibular input in bodily self-awareness.},

Adults beneﬁt from related multisensory stimuli but the extent to which the ability to optimally integrate multisensory inputs for functional purposes is present in children has not been extensively examined. Using a cross-sectional approach, high-density electrical mapping of eventrelated potentials (ERPs) was combined with behavioral measures to characterize neurodevelopmental changes in basic audiovisual (AV) integration from middle childhood through early adulthood. The data indicated a gradual ﬁne-tuning of multisensory facilitation of performance on an AV simple reaction time task (as indexed by race model violation), which reaches mature levels by about 14 years of age. They also revealed a systematic relationship between age and the brain processes underlying multisensory integration (MSI) in the time frame of the auditory N1 ERP component ({\textasciitilde}120 ms). A signiﬁcant positive correlation between behavioral and neurophysiological measures of MSI suggested that the underlying brain processes contributed to the ﬁne-tuning of multisensory facilitation of behavior that was observed over middle childhood. These ﬁndings are consistent with protracted plasticity in a dynamic system and provide a starting point from which future studies can begin to examine the developmental course of multisensory processing in clinical populations.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiology to study interoceptive regulation in healthy adolescent females. Participants regulated their gut activities in response to a virtual roller coaster by deep breathing aided by visually monitoring their online electrogastrogram (EGG) activity through a virtual thermometer (i.e., gut biofeedback), or without biofeedback. Analyses focused on the insula, given its putative role in interoception. The bilateral posterior insula showed increased activation in the nobiofeedback compared to biofeedback condition, suggesting that the participants relied more on interoceptive input when exteroceptive feedback was unavailable. The bilateral dorsal anterior insula showed activation linearly associated with age during both induction and regulation, and its activation during regulation correlated positively with change of EGG in the tachygastria frequency band from induction to regulation. Induction-related activation in the bilateral ventral anterior insula was nonlinearly associated with age and peaked at mid-adolescence. These results implicate different developmental trajectories of distinct sub-regions of the insula in interoceptive processes, with implications for competing neurobiological theories of female adolescent development.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a critical stage for the development of emotional maturity and diverse forms of psychopathology. The posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala is known to mediate fear and anxiety and is important in assigning emotional valence to cognitive processes. The medial prefrontal cortex, a homologue of the human anterior cingulate cortex, mediates emotional, attentional, and motivational behaviors at the cortical level. We postulate that the development of connectivity between these two corticolimbic regions contributes to an enhanced integration of emotion and cognition during the postnatal period. In order to characterize the development of this relay, injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin were stereotaxically placed within the posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala of rats at successive postnatal time points (postnatal days 6 –120). Labeled ﬁbers in the medial prefrontal cortex were evaluated using a combination of brightﬁeld, confocal, and electron microscopy. We found that the density of labeled ﬁbers originating from the posterior basolateral nucleus shows a sharp curvilinear increase within layers II and V of the anterior cingulate cortex and the infralimbic subdivisions of medial prefrontal cortex during the late postweanling period. This increase was paralleled by a linear rise in the number of axospinous and axodendritic synapses present in the neuropil. Based on these results, we propose that late maturation of amygdalo-cortical connectivity may provide an anatomical basis for the development and integration of normal and possibly abnormal emotional behavior during adolescence and early adulthood.

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that puberty plays an important role in the structural and functional brain development seen in adolescence, but little is known of the pubertal influence on changes in functional connectivity. We explored how pubertal indicators (salivary concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol and DHEA; pubertal stage; menarcheal status) relate to functional connectivity between components of a mentalising network identified to be engaged in social emotion processing by our prior work, using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Female adolescents aged 11 to 13 years were scanned whilst silently reading scenarios designed to evoke either social emotions (guilt and embarrassment) or basic emotions (disgust and fear), of which only social compared to basic emotions require the representation of another person’s mental states. Pubertal stage and menarcheal status were used to assign participants to pre/early or mid/late puberty groups. We found increased functional connectivity between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during social relative to basic emotion processing. Moreover, increasing oestradiol concentrations were associated with increased functional connectivity between the DMPFC and the right TPJ during social relative to basic emotion processing, independent of age. Our analysis of the PPI data by phenotypic pubertal status showed that more advanced puberty stage was associated with enhanced functional connectivity between the DMPFC and the left anterior temporal cortex (ATC) during social relative to basic emotion processing, also independent of age. Our results suggest increased functional maturation of the social brain network with the advancement of puberty in girls.},

	abstract = {Psychology and neuroscience have a long-standing tradition of studying blind individuals to investigate how visual experience shapes perception of the external world. Here, we study how blind people experience their own body by exposing them to a multisensory body illusion: the somatic rubber hand illusion. In this illusion, healthy blindfolded participants experience that they are touching their own right hand with their left index finger, when in fact they are touching a rubber hand with their left index finger while the experimenter touches their right hand in a synchronized manner (Ehrsson et al. 2005). We compared the strength of this illusion in a group of blind individuals (n = 10), all of whom had experienced severe visual impairment or complete blindness from birth, and a group of age-matched blindfolded sighted participants (n = 12). The illusion was quantified subjectively using questionnaires and behaviorally by asking participants to point to the felt location of the right hand. The results showed that the sighted participants experienced a strong illusion, whereas the blind participants experienced no illusion at all, a difference that was evident in both tests employed. A further experiment testing the participants’ basic ability to localize the right hand in space without vision (proprioception) revealed no difference between the two groups. Taken together, these results suggest that blind individuals with impaired visual development have a more veridical percept of self-touch and a less flexible and dynamic representation of their own body in space compared to sighted individuals. We speculate that the multisensory brain systems that re-map somatosensory signals onto external reference frames are less developed in blind individuals and therefore do not allow efficient fusion of tactile and proprioceptive signals from the two upper limbs into a single illusory experience of self-touch as in sighted individuals.},

	abstract = {This paper systematically reviews the literature pertaining to the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) in anorexia nervosa (AN), classifying studies on the basis of different analysis approaches. We followed PRISMA guidelines. Fifteen papers were included, investigating a total of 294 participants with current or past AN and 285 controls. The studies used seed-based, whole-brain independent component analysis (ICA), network-of-interest ICA based and graph analysis approaches. The studies showed relatively consistent overlap in results, yet little overlap in their analytical approach and/or a-priori assumptions. Functional connectivity alterations were mainly found in the corticolimbic circuitry, involved in cognitive control and visual and homeostatic integration. Some overlapping ﬁndings were found in brain areas putatively important in AN, such as the insula. These results suggest altered functional connectivity in networks/areas linked to the main symptom domains of AN, such as impaired cognitive control and body image disturbances. These preliminary evidences suggest that more targeted treatments need to be developed that focus on these two symptom domains. Further studies with multi-approach analyses and longitudinal designs are needed to better understand the complexity of AN.},

Separating those cues by virtual reality techniques, recent studies found that self-location was systematically biased to where a visual–tactile event was seen. Here we developed a novel, repeatable and implicit measure of self-location to compare and extend previous protocols. We investigated illusory self-location and associated phenomenological aspects in a lying body position that facilitates clinically observed abnormal self-location (as on out-of-body experiences). The results conﬁrm that the self is located to where touch is seen. This leads to either predictable lowering or elevation of self-localization, and the latter was accompanied by sensations of ﬂoating, as during out-of-body experiences. Using a novel measurement we show that the unitary and localized character of the self can be experimentally separated from both the origin of the visual perspective and the location of the seen body, which is compatible with clinical data.},

	abstract = {1. We studied the functional properties of neurons in the caudal part of inferior area 6 (area F4) in awake monkeys. In agreement with previous reports, we found that the large majority (87\%) of neurons responded to sensory stimuli. The responsive neurons fell into three categories: somatosensory neurons (30\%); visual neurons (14\%); and bimodal, visual and somatosensory neurons (56\%). Both somatosensory and bimodal neurons typically responded to light touch of the skin. Their RFs were located on the face, neck, trunk, and arms. Approaching objects were the most effective visual stimuli. Visual RFs were mostly located in the space near the monkey (peripersonal space). Typically they extended in the space adjacent to the tactile RFs. 2. The coordinate system in which visual RFs were coded was studied in 110 neurons. In 94 neurons the RF location was independent of eye position, remaining in the same position in the peripersonal space regardless of eye deviation. The RF location with respect to the monkey was not modified by changing monkey position in the recording room. In 10 neurons the RF's location followed the eye movements, remaining in the same retinal position (retinocentric RFs). For the remaining six neurons the RF organization was not clear. We will refer to F4 neurons with RF independent of eye position as somatocentered neurons. 3. In most somatocentered neurons (43 of 60 neurons) the background level of activity and the response to visual stimuli were not modified by changes in eye position, whereas they were modulated in the remaining 17. It is important to note that eye deviations were constantly accompanied by a synergic increase of the activity of the ipsilateral neck muscles. It is not clear, therefore, whether the modulation of neuron discharge depended on eye position or was a consequence of changes in neck muscle activity. 4. The effect of stimulus velocity (20-80 cm/s) on neuron response intensity and RF extent in depth was studied in 34 somatocentered neurons. The results showed that in most neurons the increase of stimulus velocity produced an expansion in depth of the RF. 5. We conclude that space is coded differently in areas that control somatic and eye movements. We suggest that space coding in different cortical areas depends on the computational necessity of the effectors they control.},

	abstract = {Current interpretations of extinction suggest that the disorder is due to an unbalanced competition between ipsilesional and contralesional representations of space.
            The question addressed in this study is whether the competition between left and right representations of space in one sensory modality (i.e., touch) can be reduced or exacerbated by the activation of an intact spatial representation in a different modality that is functionally linked to the damaged representation (i.e., vision). This hypothesis was tested in 10 right-hemisphere lesioned patients who suffered from reliable tactile extinction. We found that a visual stimulus presented near the patient's ipsilesional hand (i.e., visual peripersonal space) inhibited the processing of a tactile stimulus delivered on the contralesional hand (cross-modal visuotactile extinction) to the same extent as did an ipsilesional tactile stimulation (unimodal tactile extinction). It was also found that a visual stimulus presented near the contralesional hand improved the detection of a tactile stimulus applied to the same hand. In striking contrast, less modulatory effects of vision on touch perception were observed when a visual stimulus was presented far from the space immediately around the patient's hand (i.e., extrapersonal space).
            This study clearly demonstrates the existence of a visual peripersonal space centered on the hand in humans and its modulatory effects on tactile perception. These findings are explained by referring to the activity of bimodal neurons in premotor and parietal cortex of macaque, which have tactile receptive fields on the hand and corresponding visual receptive fields in the space immediately adjacent to the tactile fields.},

	abstract = {A network of brain regions including the ventral premotor cortex (vPMc) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPc) is consistently recruited during processing of multisensory stimuli within peripersonal space (PPS). However, to date, information on the causal role of these fronto-parietal areas in multisensory PPS representation is lacking. Using low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS; 1 Hz), we induced transient virtual lesions to the left vPMc, PPc, and visual cortex (V1, control site) and tested whether rTMS affected audio–tactile interaction in the PPS around the hand. Subjects performed a timed response task to a tactile stimulus on their right (contralateral to rTMS) hand while concurrent task-irrelevant sounds were presented either close to the hand or 1 m far from the hand. When no rTMS was delivered, a sound close to the hand reduced RT-to-tactile targets as compared with when a far sound was presented. This space-dependent, auditory modulation of tactile perception was specific to a hand-centered reference frame. Such a specific form of multisensory interaction near the hand can be taken as a behavioral hallmark of PPS representation. Crucially, virtual lesions to vPMc and PPc, but not to V1, eliminated the speeding effect due to near sounds, showing a disruption of audio–tactile interactions around the hand. These findings indicate that multisensory interaction around the hand depends on the functions of vPMc and PPc, thus pointing to the necessity of this human fronto-parietal network in multisensory representation of PPS.},

It maximizes the brain’s use of the information available to it at any given moment and enhances the physiological salience of external events. Because each sense conveys a unique perspective of the external world, synthesizing information across senses affords computational benefits that cannot otherwise be achieved. Multisensory integration not only has substantial survival value but can also create unique experiences that emerge when signals from different sensory channels are bound together. However, neurons in a newborn’s brain are not capable of multisensory integration, and studies in the midbrain have shown that the development of this process is not predetermined. Rather, its emergence and maturation critically depend on cross-modal experiences that alter the underlying neural circuit in such a way that optimizes multisensory integrative capabilities for the environment in which the animal will function.},

While large advances have been made with respect to understanding human sensorimotor control from an engineering approach, knowledge about its interaction with cognition and the conscious experience of movement (agency) is still sparse, especially for locomotion. We investigated these relationships by using life-size visual feedback of participants' ongoing locomotion, thereby extending agency research previously limited to goal-directed upper limb movements to continuous movements of the entire body. By introducing temporal delays and cognitive loading we were able to demonstrate distinct effects of bottom-up visuomotor conflicts as well as top-down cognitive loading on the conscious experience of locomotion (gait agency) and gait movements. While gait agency depended on the spatial and temporal congruency of the avatar feedback, gait movements were solely driven by its temporal characteristics as participants nonconsciously attempted to synchronize their gait with their avatar's gait. Furthermore, gait synchronization was suppressed by cognitive loading across all tested delays, whereas gait agency was only affected for selective temporal delays that depended on the participant's step cycle. Extending data from upper limb agency and auditory gait agency, our results are compatible with effector-independent and supramodal control of agency; they show that both mechanisms are dissociated from automated sensorimotor control and that cognitive loading further enhances this dissociation.},

In particular, the inﬂuence of performance-related sensory cues and the relevance of prediction signals for agency judgements have been studied through a variety of spatio‐temporal mismatches between movement and the sensory consequences of movement. However, agents often perform a different type of movement; highly automated movements that involve the entire body such as walking, cycling, and swimming with potentially different agency mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that the integration of multisensory signals from the body in fronto-parietal association areas underlies the perception of a body part as belonging to one's physical self. What are the neural mechanisms that enable the perception of one's entire body as a uniﬁed entity? In one behavioral and one fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis experiment, we used a full-body illusion to investigate how congruent visuo-tactile signals from a single body part facilitate the emergence of the sense of ownership of the entire body. To elicit this illusion, participants viewed the body of a mannequin from the ﬁrst-person perspective via head-mounted displays while synchronous touches were applied to the hand, abdomen, or leg of the bodies of the participant and the mannequin; asynchronous visuo-tactile stimuli served as controls. The psychometric data indicated that the participants perceived ownership of the entire artiﬁcial body regardless of the body segment that received the synchronous visuo-tactile stimuli. Based on multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that the neural responses in the left ventral premotor cortex displayed illusion-speciﬁc activity patterns that generalized across all tested pairs of body parts. Crucially, a tripartite generalization analysis revealed the whole-body speciﬁcity of these premotor activity patterns. Finally, we also identiﬁed multivoxel patterns in the premotor, intraparietal, and lateral occipital cortices and in the putamen that reﬂected multisensory responses speciﬁc to individual body parts. Based on these results, we propose that the dynamic formation of a whole-body percept may be mediated by neuronal populations in the ventral premotor cortex that contain visuo-tactile receptive ﬁelds encompassing multiple body segments.},

Cognitive self-reference always is reference to the phenomenal content of a transparent self-model. The concepts of phenomenal transparency and introspection are clarified.

However, evidence from dance practice, especially among ballet students, shows an association with mental health problems. Psychological inflexibility involves cognitive fusion, which is an excessive involvement with internal events, leading to experiential avoidance. Since studies analysing these concepts are scarce in music and dance practice, we intended to examine their effects in young music and ballet students. This study involved 113 participants (9 to 16 years old), 64.4\% girls, 34.5\% with musical training, 29.2\% with ballet training, and 36.3\% with no training. All participants completed the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) and the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y). AFQ-Y scores correlated with months of ballet training. Ballet students had greater psychological inflexibility than music students and students without any training. CAMM scores did not correlate with months of any practice, and did not distinguish between groups of practitioners. These data confirm prior findings that practice of ballet can have a potential impact on mental health by showing that young ballet students exhibit greater psychological inflexibility.},

The present study aims to evaluate those at risk for EOED in a population of students from Campania Region, Italy and to identify some correlated factors associated with the disorder (BMI, age, gender, sport/activities involvement, meal-time characteristics).
Method: sample consisted of the students of the primary and secondary schools in six municipalities near the city of Caserta (Campania-Italy). Children eating attitude test-26 (Ch-EAT-26) has been used to collect data on eating disorder behaviors and attitudes.
Results: 137 subjects, 61 female and 76 male composed the sample. Mean age was 115,38 months (SD: 10,4). Mean BMI was 20 (SD: 5). The means score at the ChEAT was 13.25 (SD: 9) and 30 children exceeded the clinical cut-off score ({\textgreater}20). There was no correlation between ChEAT score and BMI and age. Sport/activities outside the school and key figure for the child at meal time were significantly different between the clinical and non-clinical group (Ch-EAT score).
Conclusion: data showed that our sample had a higher risk for EOED compared to the overall prevalence. Dance and physical exercise were confirmed such as risk factors for eating disorders. Finally according to the results of our research, the presence of the mother at the meal- time may be a protective factor for the risk of developing and eating disorder in childhood.},

Methods: In total, 442 female high-school dance students participated in a two-phase survey. All participants completed screening questionnaires as well as measures assessing teasing, self-esteem, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, and personality. Of the participating students, 311 underwent the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders.
Results: Sixty-eight individuals (15.4\%) had an ED by DSM-IV diagnosis. The prevalence of any co-occurring mood (47.1\%) and anxiety disorders (30.9\%) was high. Although low self-esteem, high neuroticism, and high psychological distress were associated with EDs in univariate analysis, only teasing for overweight and body image dissatisfaction were signiﬁcantly associated with EDs by multivariate analysis.
Conclusion: Prevention and intervention programs for dance students should include recognition and management of emotional disorders and strategies promoting positive body image and reducing the incidence of negative weight-related comments.},

In detail, societal pressure to be thin, its internalisation, body dissatisfaction, sports pressure and early specialisation were investigated. The cross-sectional study included 46 aesthetic and 62 ball game sports athletes, and 108 age-matched non-athletes. Study methods comprised a clinical interview to detect ED and questionnaires. More athletes from aesthetic (17\%) than from ball game sports (3\%) and non-athletes (2\%) suffered from ED. Aesthetic sports athletes did not differ from non-athletes in nonsport-speciﬁc factors but obtained higher levels than ball game sports athletes in sport-speciﬁc variables (p {\textless} .01). All factors together accounted for 57.3\% of variation in disordered eating, with sports pressure and body dissatisfaction as signiﬁcant predictors. The results conﬁrm ED risk for German aesthetic athletes and indicate the importance of sports pressure and body dissatisfaction in explaining athletes’ vulnerability.

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of the main two elements of perfectionism (CM, concern over mistakes and PS, personal standards) on eating disorders risk factors in dancers. Based on the literature, we tested the role of CM and PS over diet and mood related symptoms, and the function of performance anxiety and body dissatisfaction as the main mediators in the model. Two hundreds and eighty one female dancers (M = 15.28; SDage = 2.32) from two Spanish dance conservatoires participated in this study. Structural modelling was used to test the hypothesized model. Results confirm the different influence of PS and CM on dieting and the presence of symptoms of mood disorders and performance anxiety just in the debilitative perfectionism path. In conclusion, the presence of CM might be key to differentiate dancers at higher risk of eating disorder due to its association with the variables traditionally associated to this.},

	abstract = {This article is part of a Special Issue “Puberty and Adolescence”. Puberty is one of the most frequently discussed risk periods for the development of eating disorders. Prevailing theories propose environmentally mediated sources of risk arising from the psychosocial effects (e.g., increased body dissatisfaction, decreased self-esteem) of pubertal development in girls. However, recent research highlights the potential role of ovarian hormones in phenotypic and genetic risk for eating disorders during puberty. The goal of this paper is to review data from human and animal studies in support of puberty as a critical risk period for eating disorders and evaluate the evidence for hormonal contributions. Data are consistent in suggesting that both pubertal status and pubertal timing signiﬁcantly impact risk for most eating disorders in girls, such that advanced pubertal development and early pubertal timing are associated with increased rates of eating disorders and their symptoms in both cross-sectional and longitudinal research. Findings in boys have been much less consistent and suggest a smaller role for puberty in risk for eating disorders in boys. Twin and animal studies indicate that at least part of the female-speciﬁc risk is due to genetic factors associated with estrogen activation at puberty. In conclusion, data thus far support a role for puberty in risk for eating disorders and highlight the need for additional human and animal studies of hormonal and genetic risk for eating disorders during puberty.},

The aim of this study is to systematically compile and analyse the rates of eating disorders in dancers. A literature search, appraisal and meta-analysis were conducted. Thirty-three relevant studies were published between 1966 and 2013 with sufﬁcient data for extraction. Primary data were extracted as raw numbers or conﬁdence intervals. Risk ratios and 95\% conﬁdence intervals were calculated for controlled studies. The overall prevalence of eating disorders was 12.0\% (16.4\% for ballet dancers), 2.0\% (4\% for ballet dancers) for anorexia, 4.4\% (2\% for ballet dancers) for bulimia and 9.5\% (14.9\% for ballet dancers) for eating disorders not otherwise speciﬁed (EDNOS). The dancer group had higher mean scores on the EAT-26 and the Eating Disorder Inventory subscales. Dancers, in general, had a higher risk of suffering from eating disorders in general, anorexia nervosa and EDNOS, but no higher risk of suffering from bulimia nervosa. The study concluded that as dancers had a three times higher risk of suffering from eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa and EDNOS, speciﬁcally designed services for this population should be considered.

	abstract = {Adolescence refers to the period of physical and psychological development between childhood and adulthood. The beginning of adolescence is loosely anchored to the onset of puberty, which brings dramatic alterations in hormone levels and a number of consequent physical changes. Puberty onset is also associated with profound changes in drives, motivations, psychology, and social life; these changes continue throughout adolescence. There is an increasing number of neuroimaging studies looking at the development of the brain, both structurally and functionally, during adolescence. Almost all of these studies have deﬁned development by chronological age, which shows a strong—but not unitary—correlation with pubertal stage. Very few neuroimaging studies have associated brain development with pubertal stage, and yet there is tentative evidence to suggest that puberty might play an important role in some aspects of brain and cognitive development. In this paper we describe this research, and we suggest that, in the future, developmental neuroimaging studies of adolescence should consider the role of puberty. Hum Brain Mapp 31:926–933, 2010.

These challenges highlight the need to consider the interactions among biological, psychological and sociocultural factors during the pubertal transition in the context of the ballet environment. Awareness of these potential interactions will likely provide insights as to why some dancers successfully adapt to the challenges of puberty while others have greater difficulty. This review explores how we might extend existing biocultural models to the context of ballet in order to garner a greater understanding of the pubertal transition. Future research should explore the interactions among social, psychological and biological factors during puberty in adolescent ballet dancers in order to document important determinants of adaptive responses at puberty and to inform future endeavours aimed at promoting healthy pubertal transitions among young dancers.},

This concerns cognitive performance (e.g., taking an important exam) as well as perceptual-motor performance (e.g., picking up a cup from a table). There is still much debate about how anxiety affects perceptual-motor performance. In the current paper we review the experimental literature on anxiety and perceptual-motor performance, thereby focusing on how anxiety affects the perception, selection, and realization of action possibilities. Based on this review we discuss the merits of two opposing theoretical explanations and build on existing frameworks of anxiety and cognitive performance to develop an integrated model that explains the various ways in which anxiety may speciﬁcally affect perceptual-motor performance. This model distinguishes between positive and negative effects of anxiety and, moving beyond previous approaches, recognizes three operational levels (i.e., attentional, interpretational, and behavioral) at which anxiety may affect different aspects of goal-directed action. Finally, predictions are formulated and directions for future research suggested.},

	abstract = {The emulation theory of representation is developed and explored as a framework that can revealingly synthesize a wide variety of representational functions of the brain. The framework is based on constructs from control theory (forward models) and signal processing (Kalman filters). The idea is that in addition to simply engaging with the body and environment, the brain constructs neural circuits that act as models of the body and environment. During overt sensorimotor engagement, these models are driven by efference copies in parallel with the body and environment, in order to provide expectations of the sensory feedback, and to enhance and process sensory information. These models can also be run off-line in order to produce imagery, estimate outcomes of different actions, and evaluate and develop motor plans. The framework is initially developed within the context of motor control, where it has been shown that inner models running in parallel with the body can reduce the effects of feedback delay problems. The same mechanisms can account for motor imagery as the off-line driving of the emulator via efference copies. The framework is extended to account for visual imagery as the off-line driving of an emulator of the motor-visual loop. I also show how such systems can provide for amodal spatial imagery. Perception, including visual perception, results from such models being used to form expectations of, and to interpret, sensory input. I close by briefly outlining other cognitive functions that might also be synthesized within this framework, including reasoning, theory of mind phenomena, and language.},

	abstract = {Research in embodied and grounded cognition is defined by the types of hypotheses researchers pursue, with specific emphasis on the ways in which the body, brain, and environment interact to give rise to intelligent behaviour. In cognitive neuroscience, it is hypothesized that simulations in modality-specific representations, situated and embedded in a behavioral context, underlie our ability to plan actions, discuss our thoughts, and coordinate our activities with each other. In this framework, representations are powerful, predictive constructs, and integrate the brain (i.e. neural networks), body, and immediate environment. Overall, the grounded perspective encourages us to think deeply about our cognitive ontology, cognition’s relation to the brain, and the dynamic processes that underlie our most complex behaviors. In this way, embodied and grounded perspectives promise to shape research in cognitive neuroscience in highly productive ways.},

While such ﬁndings are primarily driven by the recent proliferation of neuroimaging studies, the psychophysical tasks that complement those investigations have received little attention. In this review, we discuss the literature that involves the subjective appraisal of body representation in patients with chronic pain. We do so by examining three broad sensory systems that form the foundations of the sense of physical self in patients with common chronic pain disorders: (i) reweighting of proprioceptive information; (ii) altered sensitivity to exteroceptive stimuli; and, (iii) disturbed interoceptive awareness of the state of the body. Such ﬁndings present compelling evidence for a multisensory and multimodal approach to therapies for chronic pain disorders.},

Preliminary researches correlated pain with alterations in the interoceptive matrix albeit, to the best of our knowledge, interoceptive alterations in chronic pain conditions have never been studied systematically. We searched for studies that assessed interoception in subjects with chronic pain and compared it to healthy population. Eleven studies were included among different chronic pain conditions. Results suggested that chronic pain subjects might present low IAc and, allegedly, that IAc negatively correlates with symptoms severity in speciﬁc disorders. Data were inconclusive for IAs and IAw. The high risk of bias across multiple dimensions suggests to consider these conclusions with cautions. Nonetheless, deﬁcits in interoceptive processes indicate a promising path for new form of therapies, and they require further attention and a more deﬁned line of research.},

	abstract = {During the rubber hand illusion (RHI), subjects experience an artificial hand as part of their own body, while the real hand is subject to a sort of 'disembodiment'. Can this altered belief about the body also affect physiological mechanisms involved in body-ownership, such as motor control? Here we ask whether the excitability of the motor pathways to the real (disembodied) hand are affected by the illusion. Our results show that the amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials recorded from the real hand is significantly reduced, with respect to baseline, when subjects in the synchronous (but not in the asynchronous) condition experience the fake hand as their own. This finding contributes to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between body-ownership and motor system, and provides the first physiological evidence that a significant drop in motor excitability in M1 hand circuits accompanies the disembodiment of the real hand during the RHI experience.
          , 
            The feeling of body ownership — that the various parts of your body are all part of you — is something that we typically take for granted. However, brain damage can disrupt this sensation and leave individuals convinced that an arm or a leg is no longer their own. Even in healthy people, the ‘rubber hand illusion’ can temporarily produce a similar phenomenon. Individuals watch a lifelike rubber hand being touched while their own hand – which is hidden from view – is touched at the same time. This creates the feeling that the artificial hand has become part of their body, while their real hand is left in a ‘disembodied’ state.
            How does the brain generate this illusory sense of ownership and accompanying sense of disembodiment? A person’s ability to move their body is thought to contribute to their feeling of body ownership. Therefore, della Gatta, Garbarini et al. asked whether the brain’s ability to move the real hand changes during the rubber hand illusion.
            In the experiments, the region of the brain that controls hand movement was artificially stimulated in a number of volunteers. When an individual had been primed by the rubber hand illusion to perceive a fake hand as part of their own body, their brain was temporarily less able to activate the muscles of their real hand. This is as if the brain no longer considered the real hand as part of the body. Thus, the altered sense of body ownership experienced during the rubber hand illusion is not a bizarre fantasy, but corresponds to a physiological reaction that accompanies changes in brain activity.
            The next step is to further define and quantify the relationship between the sense of body ownership and the control of body movement. Specifically, how does activity in the brain areas that control movement contribute to the sense of body ownership? And how do these brain regions communicate with one another to generate a sense of self?},

Here I argue that, despite recent insights suggesting that multisensory interactions can occur at very early latencies, the actual integration of individual sensory traces into an internally consistent mental representation is dependent on both top–down and bottom–up processes. Moreover, I argue that this integration is not limited to just sensory inputs, but that internal cognitive processes also shape the resulting mental representation. Studies showing that memory recall is affected by the initial multisensory context in which the stimuli were presented will be discussed, as well as several studies showing that mental imagery can affect multisensory illusions. This empirical evidence will be discussed from a predictive coding perspective, in which a central top–down attentional process is proposed to play a central role in coordinating the integration of all these inputs into a coherent mental representation.},

The present article outlays both mind-based and brain-based views highlighting their shortcomings. We propose that full insight into what should be conceived a “xenomelia spectrum disorder” will require interpretation of individual symptomatology in a social context. A proper social neuroscience of xenomelia respects the functional neuroanatomy of corporeal awareness, but also acknowledges the brain’s plasticity in response to an individual’s history, which is lived against a cultural background.

With the aim of unrevealing where in the brain interoceptive and exteroceptive signals may converge, we performed a metaanalysis on imaging studies of the sense of body ownership, modulated by external visuotactile stimulation, and studies on interoception, which involves the selfawareness for internal bodily sensations. Using a multilevel kernel density analysis, we found that processing of stimuli of the two domains converges primarily in the supramarginal gyrus bilaterally. Furthermore, we found a right-lateralized set of areas, including the precentral and postcentral, and superior temporal gyri. We discuss these results and propose this set of areas as ideal candidates to match multiple body-related signals contributing to the creation of a multidimensional representation of the bodily self.},

	abstract = {Identifying with a body is central to being a conscious self. The now classic “rubber hand illusion” demonstrates that the experience of body-ownership can be modulated by manipulating the timing of exteroceptive (visual and tactile) body-related feedback. Moreover, the strength of this modulation is related to individual differences in sensitivity to internal bodily signals (interoception). However the interaction of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals in determining the experience of body-ownership within an individual remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that this depends on the online integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals by implementing an innovative “cardiac rubber hand illusion” that combined computer-generated augmented-reality with feedback of interoceptive (cardiac) information. We show that both subjective and objective measures of virtual-hand ownership are enhanced by cardio-visual feedback in-time with the actual heartbeat, as compared to asynchronous feedback. We further show that these measures correlate with individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity, and are also modulated by the integration of proprioceptive signals instantiated using realtime visual remapping of ﬁnger movements to the virtual hand. Our results demonstrate that interoceptive signals directly inﬂuence the experience of body ownership via multisensory integration, and they lend support to models of conscious selfhood based on interoceptive predictive coding.},

	abstract = {The Brain’s ability to integrate information from different modalities (multisensory integration) is fundamental for accurate sensory experience and efficient interaction with the environment: it enhances detection of external stimuli, disambiguates conflict situations, speeds up responsiveness, facilitates processes of memory retrieval and object recognition. Multisensory integration operates at several brain levels: in subcortical structures (especially the Superior Colliculus), in higher-level associative cortices (e.g., posterior parietal regions), and even in early cortical areas (such as primary cortices) traditionally considered to be purely unisensory. Because of complex non-linear mechanisms of brain integrative phenomena, a key tool for their understanding is represented by neurocomputational models. This review examines different modelling principles and architectures, distinguishing the models on the basis of their aims: (i) Bayesian models based on probabilities and realizing optimal estimator of external cues; (ii) biologically inspired models of multisensory integration in the Superior Colliculus and in the Cortex, both at level of single neuron and network of neurons, with emphasis on physiological mechanisms and architectural schemes; among the latter, some models exhibit synaptic plasticity and reproduce development of integrative capabilities via Hebbian-learning rules or self-organizing maps; (iii) models of semantic memory that implement object meaning as a fusion between sensory–motor features (embodied cognition). This overview paves the way to future challenges, such as reconciling neurophysiological and Bayesian models into a unifying theory, and stimulates upcoming research in both theoretical and applicative domains.},

In contrast, modern textbooks typically explain the perception of object size and distance by the combination of information from different visual cues. Here, we describe full body illusions in which subjects experience the ownership of a doll’s body (80 cm or 30 cm) and a giant’s body (400 cm) and use these as tools to demonstrate that the size of one’s sensed own body directly influences the perception of object size and distance. These effects were quantified in ten separate experiments with complementary verbal, questionnaire, manual, walking, and physiological measures. When participants experienced the tiny body as their own, they perceived objects to be larger and farther away, and when they experienced the large-body illusion, they perceived objects to be smaller and nearer. Importantly, despite identical retinal input, this ‘‘body size effect’’ was greater when the participants experienced a sense of ownership of the artificial bodies compared to a control condition in which ownership was disrupted. These findings are fundamentally important as they suggest a causal relationship between the representations of body space and external space. Thus, our own body size affects how we perceive the world.},

	abstract = {Understanding how self-representation is built, maintained and updated across the lifespan is a fundamental challenge for cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Studies demonstrate that the detection of body-related multisensory congruency builds bodily and facial self-representations that are crucial to developing self-recognition. Studies showing that the bodily self is more malleable than previously believed were mainly concerned with full-bodies and non-facial body parts. Crucially, however, intriguing recent evidence indicates that simple experimental manipulations could even affect self-face representation that has long been considered a stable construct impervious to change. In this review, we discuss how Interpersonal Multisensory Stimulation (IMS) paradigms can be used to temporarily induce Enfacement, i.e., the subjective illusion of looking at oneself in the mirror when in fact looking at another person's face. We show that Enfacement is a subtle but robust phenomenon occurring in a variety of experimental conditions and assessed by multiple explicit and implicit measures. We critically discuss recent ﬁndings on i) the role of sensory extero/proprio-ceptive (visual, tactile, and motor) and interoceptive (cardiac) signals in self-face plasticity, ii) the importance of multisensory integration mechanisms for the bodily self, and iii) the neural network related to IMS-driven changes in self-other face processing, within the predictive coding theoretical framework.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identiﬁcation of nonlinear input–state– output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the inﬂuence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identiﬁcation proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reﬂect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic.},

	abstract = {Visual cortical responses are usually attenuated by repetition, a phenomenon known as repetition suppression (RS). Here, we use multivoxel pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to show that RS co-occurs with the converse phenomenon (repetition enhancement, RE) in a single cortical region. We presented human volunteers with short sequences of repeated faces and measured brain activity using fMRI. In an independently deﬁned face-responsive extrastriate region, the response of each voxel to repetition (RS vs. RE) was consistent across scanner runs, and multivoxel patterns for both RS and RE voxels were stable. Moreover, RS and RE voxels responded to repetition with dissociable latencies and exhibited different patterns of connectivity with lower and higher visual regions. Computational simulations demonstrated that these effects must be due to differences in repetition sensitivity, and not feature selectivity. These ﬁndings establish that 2 classes of repetition responses coexist within 1 visual region and support models acknowledging this distinction, such as predictive coding models where perception requires the computation of both predictions (which are enhanced by repetition) and prediction errors (which are suppressed by repetition).},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging has demonstrated that the illusory self-attribution of body parts engages frontal and intraparietal brain areas, and recent evidence further suggests an involvement of visual bodyselective regions in the occipitotemporal cortex. However, little is known about the principles of information exchange within this network. Here, using automated congruent versus incongruent visuotactile stimulation of distinct anatomical locations on the participant’s right arm and a realistic dummy counterpart in an fMRI scanner, we induced an illusory self-attribution of the dummy arm. The illusion consistently activated a left-hemispheric network comprising ventral premotor cortex (PMv), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and body-selective regions of the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOC). Importantly, during the illusion, the functional coupling of the PMv and the IPS with the LOC increased substantially, and dynamic causal modeling revealed a signiﬁcant enhancement of connections from the LOC and the secondary somatosensory cortex to the IPS. These results comply with the idea that the brain’s inference mechanisms rely on the hierarchical propagation of prediction error. During illusory self-attribution, unpredicted ambiguous sensory input about one’s body conﬁguration may result in the generation of such prediction errors in visual and somatosensory areas, which may be conveyed to parietal integrative areas.

To this end, in Study 1, participants reported on self-concept clarity (SCC) and completed the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI), a paradigm in which synchronous (versus asynchronous) stimulation between a prosthetic hand and one’s own hand leads one to “embody” the prosthetic hand. Whereas participants were equally susceptible to the RHI during synchronous stroking, low SCC individuals were more vulnerable to the illusion during asynchronous stroking, when the effect is unwarranted. Conceptually replicating and extending this finding, in Study 2, low SCC individuals were more susceptible to the body-swap illusion—the impression that another person’s body is one’s own.

Overall, differences in RHI experience between the BDD group and healthy and schizophrenia control groups (n = 17 in each) were not significant. RHI strength, however, was positively associated with body dissatisfaction and related tendencies. For the healthy control group, proprioceptive drift towards the rubber hand was observed following synchronous but not asynchronous stimulation, a typical pattern when inducing the RHI. Similar drifts in proprioceptive awareness occurred for the BDD group irrespective of whether stimulation was synchronous or not.

	abstract = {Background Body representation disturbances in body schema (i.e. unconscious sensorimotor body representations for action) have been frequently reported in eating disorders. Recently, it has been proposed that body schema relies on adequate functioning of the motor system, which is strongly implicated in discriminating between one’s own and someone else’s body. The present study aimed to investigate the motor-based bodily self in eating disorders and controls, in order to examine the role of the motor system in body representation disturbances at the body schema level.
Method Female outpatients diagnosed with eating disorders (N = 15), and healthy controls (N = 18) underwent a hand laterality task, in which their own (self-stimuli) and someone else’s hands (other-stimuli) were displayed at different orientations. Participants had to mentally rotate their own hand in order to provide a laterality judgement. Group differences in motor-based bodily self-recognition—i.e. whether a general advantage occurred when implicitly processing self- vs. other-stimuli − were evaluated, by analyzing response times and accuracy by means of mixed ANOVAs.
Results Patients with eating disorders did not show a temporal advantage when mentally rotating self-stimuli compared to other-stimuli, as opposed to controls (F(1, 31) = 5.6, p = 0.02; eating disorders-other = 1092 ±256 msec, eating disorders-self = 1097±254 msec; healthy controls-other = 1239±233 msec, healthy controls -self = 1192±232 msec).
Conclusion This study provides initial indication that high-level motor functions might be compromised as part of body schema disturbances in eating disorders. Further larger investigations are},

Twenty subjects were recruited in a within-groups study where 10 first experienced a virtual character that synchronously reflected their upper-body movements as seen in a virtual mirror, and then an asynchronous condition where the mirror avatar displayed prerecorded actions, unrelated to those of the participant. The other 10 subjects experienced the conditions in the opposite order. In both conditions the participant could carry out actions that led to elevation above ground level, as seen from their first person perspective and correspondingly in the mirror. A rotating virtual fan eventually descended to 2m above the ground. The hypothesis was that synchronous mirror reflection would result in higher subjective sense of ownership. A questionnaire analysis showed that the body ownership illusion was significantly greater for the synchronous than asynchronous condition. Additionally participants in the synchronous condition avoided collision with the descending fan significantly more often than those in the asynchronous condition. The results of this experiment are put into context within similar experiments on multisensory correlation and body ownership within cognitive neuroscience.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present two neural network models – devoted to two specific and widely investigated aspects of multisensory integration – in order to evidence the potentialities of computational models to gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying organization, development, and plasticity of multisensory integration in the brain.The first model considers visual–auditory interaction in a midbrain structure named superior colliculus (SC).The model is able to reproduce and explain the main physiological features of multisensory integration in SC neurons and to describe how SC integrative capability – not present at birth – develops gradually during postnatal life depending on sensory experience with cross-modal stimuli. The second model tackles the problem of how tactile stimuli on a body part and visual (or auditory) stimuli close to the same body part are integrated in multimodal parietal neurons to form the perception of peripersonal (i.e., near) space. The model investigates how the extension of peripersonal space – where multimodal integration occurs – may be modified by experience such as use of a tool to interact with the far space. The utility of the modeling approach relies on several aspects: (i) The two models, although devoted to different problems and simulating different brain regions, share some common mechanisms (lateral inhibition and excitation, non-linear neuron characteristics, recurrent connections, competition, Hebbian rules of potentiation and depression) that may govern more generally the fusion of senses in the brain, and the learning and plasticity of multisensory integration. (ii)The models may help interpretation of behavioral and psychophysical responses in terms of neural activity and synaptic connections. (iii) The models can make testable predictions that can help guiding future experiments in order to validate, reject, or modify the main assumptions.},

We simplify and extend these results by presenting a simulation using traditional self-organizing maps, intended to understand and simulate MSE as it may generally occur throughout the central nervous system.This simulation of MSE: (1) uses a standard unsupervised competitive learning algorithm, (2) learns from artiﬁcially generated activation levels corresponding to driven and spontaneous stimuli from separate and combined input channels, (3) uses a sigmoidal transfer function to generate quantiﬁable responses to separate inputs, (4) enhances the responses when those same inputs are combined, (5) obeys the inverse effectiveness principle of multisensory integration, and (6) can topographically congregate MSE in a manner similar to that seen in cortex. Thus, the model provides a useful method for evaluating and simulating the development of enhanced interactions between responses to different sensory modalities.},

	abstract = {Cross-modal enhancement (CME) occurs when the neural response to a stimulus of one modality is augmented by another stimulus of a different modality. Paired stimuli of the same modality never produce supra-additive enhancement but may produce modality-specific suppression (MSS), in which the response to a stimulus of one modality is diminished by another stimulus of the same modality. Both CME and MSS have been described for neurons in the deep layers of the superior colliculus (DSC), but their neural mechanisms remain unknown. Previous investigators have suggested that CME involves a multiplicative amplifier, perhaps mediated by N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which is engaged by cross-modal but not modality-specific input. We previously postulated that DSC neurons use multisensory input to compute the posterior probability of a target using Bayes' rule. The Bayes' rule model reproduces the major features of CME. Here we use simple neural implementations of our model to simulate both CME and MSS and to argue that multiplicative processes are not needed for CME, but may be needed to represent input variance and covariance. Producing CME requires only weighted summation of inputs and the threshold and saturation properties of simple models of biological neurons. Multiplicative nodes allow accurate computation of posterior target probabilities when the spontaneous and driven inputs have unequal variances and covariances. Neural implementations of the Bayes' rule model account better than the multiplicative amplifier hypothesis for the effects of pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors on the multisensory responses of DSC neurons. The neural implementations also account for MSS, given only the added hypothesis that input channels of the same modality have more spontaneous covariance than those of different modalities.},

However, in most studies projected or mirrored images of own hands were presented as ‘artificial’ body parts. Using the paradigm of the rubber hand illusion (RHI), we assessed the impact of tactile sensations and voluntary movements with respect to an unambiguously body-extraneous, artificial hand. In addition to phenomenal self-reports and pointing movements towards the own hand, we introduced a new procedure for perceptual judgements enabling the assessment of proprioceptive drift and judgement reliability regarding perceived hand location. RHI effects were comparable for tactile sensations and voluntary movements, but characteristic discrepancies were found for pointing movements. They were differently affected by the induction methods, and RHI effects were uncorrelated between both methods. These observations shed new light on inconsistent results concerning RHI effects on motor responses.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Humans experience touch as pleasant when this occurs with a certain velocity (1–10cm/s). Affective, pleasant touch is thought to be mediated by a distinct neural pathway consisting of un-myelinated tactile afferents (C tactile ﬁbers) that respond to stroking with a low velocity on the hairy skin. As pleasant touch provides additional information on bodily signals we hypothesized that, compared to regular touch, pleasant touch would have a stronger effect on body ownership as measured through induction of the rubber hand illusion (RHI).
Methods: Two experiments involving the RHI were conducted. In the ﬁrst experiment, the effects of stroking velocity (3 cm/s and 30 cm/s) and stroking material (soft/rough) on the RHI were tested. In the second experiment, the effect of an additional stroking velocity (0.3 cm/s) and side of stimulation (hairy and glabrous) was examined.
Results: The ﬁrst experiment showed that low velocity stroking in combination with a soft material was not only regarded as most pleasant but also resulted in an enhanced RHI on proprioceptive drift and temperature measurements. In the second experiment, we conﬁrmed that stroking with a velocity of 3 cm/s resulted in a larger RHI in terms of proprioceptive drift. In addition, compared to regular touch, pleasant touch of the hairy skin resulted in a larger proprioceptive drift, while similar stroking on the glabrous side of the skin did not induce a stronger effect of RHI on proprioceptive drift.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that pleasant touch modulates the body representation which is consistently reﬂected in a larger proprioceptive drift. Our data also suggest that C tactile ﬁbers are likely to be involved in the modulation of body ownership.},

	abstract = {Un-myelinated C tactile afferents (CT afferents) are a key ﬁnding in affective touch. These ﬁbers, which activate in response to a caress-like touch to hairy skin (CT afferents are not found in palm skin), may have more in common with interoceptive systems encoding body ownership, than afferent systems processing other tactile stimuli. We tested whether subjective embodiment of a rubber hand (measured through questionnaire items) was increased when tactile stimulation was applied to the back of the hand at a rate optimal for CT afferents (3 cm/s) vs. stimulation of glabrous skin (on the palm of the hand) or at a non-optimal rate (30 cm/s), which should not activate these ﬁbers. We also collected ratings of tactile pleasantness and a measure of perceived limb position, proprioceptive drift, which is mediated by different mechanisms of multisensory integration than those responsible for feelings of ownership. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that proprioceptive drift was a signiﬁcant predictor of subjective strength of the illusion when tactile stimuli were applied to the back of the hand, regardless of stroking speed. This relationship was modiﬁed by pleasantness, with higher ratings when stimulation was applied to the back of the hand at the slower vs. faster stroking speed. Pleasantness was also a unique predictor of illusion strength when fast stroking was applied to the palm of the hand. However, there were no conditions under which pleasantness was a signiﬁcant predictor of drift. Since the illusion was demonstrated at a non-optimal stroking speed an integrative role for CT afferents within the illusion cannot be fully supported. Pleasant touch, however, does moderate the subjective aspects of the rubber hand illusion, which under certain tactile conditions may interact with proprioceptive information about the body or have a unique inﬂuence on subjective body perception.},

	abstract = {Many recent studies analyze how data from different modalities can be combined. Often this is modeled as a system that optimally combines several sources of information about the same variable. However, it has long been realized that this information combining depends on the interpretation of the data. Two cues that are perceived by different modalities can have different causal relationships: (1) They can both have the same cause, in this case we should fully integrate both cues into a joint estimate. (2) They can have distinct causes, in which case information should be processed independently. In many cases we will not know if there is one joint cause or two independent causes that are responsible for the cues. Here we model this situation as a Bayesian estimation problem. We are thus able to explain some experiments on visual auditory cue combination as well as some experiments on visual proprioceptive cue integration. Our analysis shows that the problem solved by people when they combine cues to produce a movement is much more complicated than is usually assumed, because they need to infer the causal structure that is underlying their sensory experience.},

	abstract = {Predictive processing (PP) approaches to the mind are increasingly popular in the cognitive sciences. This surge of interest is accompanied by a proliferation of philosophical arguments, which seek to either extend or oppose various aspects of the emerging framework. In particular, the question of how to position predictive processing with respect to enactive and embodied cognition has become a topic of intense debate. While these arguments are certainly of valuable scientiﬁc and philosophical merit, they risk underestimating the variety of approaches gathered under the predictive label. Here, we ﬁrst present a basic review of neuroscientiﬁc, cognitive, and philosophical approaches to PP, to illustrate how these range from solidly cognitivist applications—with a ﬁrm commitment to modular, internalistic mental representation—to more moderate views emphasizing the importance of ‘bodyrepresentations’, and ﬁnally to those which ﬁt comfortably with radically enactive, embodied, and dynamic theories of mind. Any nascent predictive processing theory (e.g., of attention or consciousness) must take into account this continuum of views, and associated theoretical commitments. As a ﬁnal point, we illustrate how the Free Energy Principle (FEP) attempts to dissolve tension between internalist and externalist accounts of cognition, by providing a formal synthetic account of how internal ‘representations’ arise from autopoietic self-organization. The FEP thus furnishes empirically productive process theories (e.g., predictive processing) by which to guide discovery through the formal modelling of the embodied mind.},

To identify the functional anatomy of the RHI, we used multichannel EEG, acquired under three conditions of tactile stimulation. Evoked potentials were averaged from EEG signals registered to the timing of brushstrokes to the participant's hand. The participant's hand was stroked either in the absence of an artificial hand (REAL) or synchronously with an artificial hand, which either lay in an anatomically plausible (CONGRUENT) or impossible (INCONGRUENT) position. The illusion was reliably elicited in the CONGRUENT condition. For right-hand stimulation, significant differences between conditions emerged at the sensor level around 55 msec after the brushstroke at left frontal and right parietal electrodes. Response amplitudes were smaller for illusory (CONGRUENT) compared with nonillusory (INCONGRUENT and REAL) conditions in the contralateral perirolandic region (pre- and postcentral gyri), superior and inferior parietal lobule, whereas veridical perception of the artificial hand (INCONGRUENT) amplified responses at a scalp region overlying the contralateral postcentral gyrus and inferior parietal lobule compared with the remaining two conditions. Left-hand stimulation produced similar contralateral patterns. These results are consistent with predictive coding models of multisensory integration and may reflect the attenuation of somatosensory precision that is required to resolve perceptual hypotheses about conflicting multisensory input.},

These models assume that the sensory cortex infers the most likely values of attributes or features of sensory stimuli from the noisy inputs encoding the stimuli. Remarkably, these models describe how this inference could be implemented in a network of very simple computational elements, suggesting that this inference could be performed by biological networks of neurons. Furthermore, learning about the parameters describing the features and their uncertainty is implemented in these models by simple rules of synaptic plasticity based on Hebbian learning. This tutorial introduces the free-energy framework using very simple examples, and provides step-by-step derivations of the model. It also discusses in more detail how the model could be implemented in biological neural circuits. In particular, it presents an extended version of the model in which the neurons only sum their inputs, and synaptic plasticity only depends on activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.},

This intriguing phenomenon relies on the brain's ability to detect statistical correlations in the multisensory inputs (ie visual, tactile, and proprioceptive), but it is also modulated by the pre-existing representation of one's own body. Nonetheless, researchers appear to have accepted the assumption that the size of the seen hand does not matter for this illusion to occur. Here we used a real-time video image of the participant's own hand to elicit the illusion, but we varied the hand size in the video image so that the seen hand was either reduced, veridical, or enlarged in comparison to the participant's own hand. The results showed that visible-hand size modulated the illusion, which was present for veridical and enlarged images of the hand, but absent when the visible hand was reduced. These findings indicate that very specific aspects of our own body image (ie hand size) can constrain the multisensory modulation of the body schema highlighted by the fake-hand illusion paradigm. In addition, they suggest an asymmetric tendency to acknowledge enlarged (but not reduced) images of body parts within our body representation.},

The perceived location of the real hand is shifted towards the location of the artiﬁcial hand. However, evidence as to whether the RHI is accompanied by alterations of hand action is mixed. We found that the perceived size of one's own hand was affected by the size of the artiﬁcial hand that was used to elicit the illusion. Moreover, we tested a possible transfer of the RHI to a reach-to-grasp action. We observed that hand transport (i.e., reach) errors after RHI induction were independent of artiﬁcial hand size, showing that the parameter which is important for these reaching errors is the hand's perceived location. Results thus show that the RHI affects not only perceptual, but also action processing. In contrast, grip aperture was affected by artiﬁcial hand size independent of the RHI, suggesting that visual information about hand size affects grasping independent of embodiment of the artiﬁcial hand. Grip size increased with artiﬁcial hand size; this effect is explained by a higher reliance on proprioceptive information during blind reaching after receiving distorted visual information.},

When one’s own hand is placed out of view and a visible fake hand is repeatedly stroked and tapped in synchrony with the unseen hand, subjects report a strong sense in which the fake hand is experienced as part of their own body. In our experiment, we investigated this illusion under three conditions: (i) unmediated condition, replicating the original paradigm, (ii) virtual reality (VR) condition, where both the fake hand and its stimulation were projected on the table in front of the participant, and (iii) mixed reality (MR) condition, where the fake hand was projected, but its stimulation was unmediated. Dependent measures included self-report (open-ended and questionnaire-based) and drift, that is, the offset between the felt position of the hidden hand and its actual position. As expected, the unmediated condition produced the strongest illusion, as indicated both by selfreport and drift towards the rubber hand. The VR condition produced a more convincing subjective illusion than the MR condition, although no difference in drift was found between the mediated conditions. Results are discussed in terms of perceptual mechanisms underlying the rubber hand illusion, and the illusion’s relevance to understanding telepresence.},

Both visuomotor (VM) and visuotactile (VT) synchronous stimulation have been shown to be important for inducing a body ownership illusion, each tested separately or both in combination. In this study we compared the relative importance of these two cross-modal correlations, when both are provided in the same immersive virtual reality setup and the same experiment. We systematically manipulated VT and VM contingencies in order to assess their relative role and mutual interaction. Moreover, we present a new method for measuring the induced body ownership illusion through time, by recording reports of breaks in the illusion of ownership (‘breaks’) throughout the experimental phase. The balance of the evidence, from both questionnaires and analysis of the breaks, suggests that while VM synchronous stimulation contributes the greatest to the attainment of the illusion, a disruption of either (through asynchronous stimulation) contributes equally to the probability of a break in the illusion.},

However, the extent to which gross asymmetries in the fake body can be assimilated remains unknown. Participants experienced, through a head-tracked stereo head-mounted display a virtual body coincident with their real body. There were 5 conditions in a between-groups experiment, with 10 participants per condition. In all conditions there was visuo-motor congruence between the real and virtual dominant arm. In an Incongruent condition (I), where the virtual arm length was equal to the real length, there was visuo-tactile incongruence. In four Congruent conditions there was visuo-tactile congruence, but the virtual arm lengths were either equal to (C1), double (C2), triple (C3) or quadruple (C4) the real ones. Questionnaire scores and defensive withdrawal movements in response to a threat showed that the overall level of ownership was high in both C1 and I, and there was no significant difference between these conditions. Additionally, participants experienced ownership over the virtual arm up to three times the length of the real one, and less strongly at four times the length. The illusion did decline, however, with the length of the virtual arm. In the C2–C4 conditions although a measure of proprioceptive drift positively correlated with virtual arm length, there was no correlation between the drift and ownership of the virtual arm, suggesting different underlying mechanisms between ownership and drift. Overall, these findings extend and enrich previous results that multisensory and sensorimotor information can reconstruct our perception of the body shape, size and symmetry even when this is not consistent with normal body proportions.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that it is possible to generate perceptual illusions of ownership in immersive virtual reality (IVR) over a virtual body seen from first person perspective, in other words over a body that visually substitutes the person’s real body. This can occur even when the virtual body is quite different in appearance from the person’s real body. However, investigation of the psychological, behavioral and attitudinal consequences of such body transformations remains an interesting problem with much to be discovered. Thirty six Caucasian people participated in a between-groups experiment where they played a West-African Djembe hand drum while immersed in IVR and with a virtual body that substituted their own. The virtual hand drum was registered with a physical drum. They were alongside a virtual character that played a drum in a supporting, accompanying role. In a baseline condition participants were represented only by plainly shaded white hands, so that they were able merely to play. In the experimental condition they were represented either by a casually dressed dark-skinned virtual body (Casual Dark-Skinned - CD) or by a formal suited light-skinned body (Formal Light-Skinned - FL). Although participants of both groups experienced a strong body ownership illusion towards the virtual body, only those with the CD representation showed significant increases in their movement patterns for drumming compared to the baseline condition and compared with those embodied in the FL body. Moreover, the stronger the illusion of body ownership in the CD condition, the greater this behavioral change. A path analysis showed that the observed behavioral changes were a function of the strength of the illusion of body ownership towards the virtual body and its perceived appropriateness for the drumming task. These results demonstrate that full body ownership illusions can lead to substantial behavioral and possibly cognitive changes depending on the appearance of the virtual body. This could be important for many applications such as learning, education, training, psychotherapy and rehabilitation using IVR.},

A racial Implicit Association Test (IAT) was administered at least three days prior to the experiment, and immediately after the IVR exposure. The change from pre- to post-experience IAT scores suggests that the dark-skinned embodied condition decreased implicit racial bias more than the other conditions.

	abstract = {Bodily illusions have been used to study bodily self-consciousness and disentangle its various components, among other the sense of ownership and self-location. Congruent multimodal correlations between the real body and a fake humanoid body can in fact trigger the illusion that the fake body is one’s own and/or disrupt the unity between the perceived self-location and the position of the physical body. However, the extent to which changes in self-location entail changes in ownership is still matter of debate. Here we address this problem with the support of immersive virtual reality. Congruent visuotactile stimulation was delivered on healthy participants to trigger full body illusions from different visual perspectives, each resulting in a different degree of overlap between real and virtual body. Changes in ownership and self-location were measured with novel self-posture assessment tasks and with an adapted version of the cross-modal congruency task. We found that, despite their strong coupling, self-location and ownership can be selectively altered: self-location was affected when having a third person perspective over the virtual body, while ownership toward the virtual body was experienced only in the conditions with total or partial overlap. Thus, when the virtual body is seen in the far extra-personal space, changes in self-location were not coupled with changes in ownership. If a partial spatial overlap is present, ownership was instead typically experienced with a boosted change in the perceived self-location. We discussed results in the context of the current knowledge of the multisensory integration mechanisms contributing to self-body perception. We argue that changes in the perceived self-location are associated to the dynamical representation of peripersonal space encoded by visuotactile neurons.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of how the brain maintains a probabilistic body state estimate over time from a modeling perspective. The neural Modular Modality Frame (nMMF) model simulates such a body state estimation process by continuously integrating redundant, multimodal body state information sources. The body state estimate itself is distributed over separate, but bidirectionally interacting modules. nMMF compares the incoming sensory and present body state information across the interacting modules and fuses the information sources accordingly. At the same time, nMMF enforces body state estimation consistency across the modules. nMMF is able to detect conﬂicting sensory information and to consequently decrease the inﬂuence of implausible sensor sources on the ﬂy. In contrast to the previously published Modular Modality Frame (MMF) model, nMMF offers a biologically plausible neural implementation based on distributed, probabilistic population codes. Besides its neural plausibility, the neural encoding has the advantage of enabling (a) additional probabilistic information ﬂow across the separate body state estimation modules and (b) the representation of arbitrary probability distributions of a body state. The results show that the neural estimates can detect and decrease the impact of false sensory information, can propagate conﬂicting information across modules, and can improve overall estimation accuracy due to additional module interactions. Even bodily illusions, such as the rubber hand illusion, can be simulated with nMMF. We conclude with an outlook on the potential of modeling human data and of invoking goal-directed behavioral control.},

	abstract = {Many authors have performed experiments in which subjects grasp objects in illusory surroundings. The vast majority of these studies report that illusions affect the maximum grip aperture less than they affect the perceived size. This observation has frequently been regarded as experimental evidence for separate visual systems for perception and action. In order to make this conclusion, one assumes that the grip aperture is based on a visual estimate of the object’s size. We believe that it is not, and that this is why size illusions fail to influence grip aperture. Illusions generally do not affect all aspects of space perception in a consistent way, but mainly affect the perception of specific spatial attributes. This applies not only to object size, but also to other spatial attributes such as position, orientation, displacement, speed, and direction of motion. Whether an illusion influences the execution of a task will therefore depend on which spatial attributes are used rather than on whether the task is perceptual or motor. To evaluate whether illusions affect actions when they influence the relevant spatial attributes we review experimental results on various tasks with inconsistent spatial processing in mind. Doing so shows that many actions are susceptible to visual illusions. We argue that the frequently reported differential effect of illusions on perceptual judgements and goal-directed action is caused by failures to ensure that the same spatial attributes are used in the two tasks. Illusions only affect those aspects of a task that are based on the spatial attributes that are affected by the illusion.},

	abstract = {Neuropsychological studies prompted the theory that the primate visual system might be organized into two parallel pathways, one for conscious perception and one for guiding action. Supporting evidence in healthy subjects seemed to come from a dissociation in visual illusions: In previous studies, the Ebbinghaus (or Titchener) illusion deceived perceptual judgments of size, but only marginally influenced the size estimates used in grasping. Contrary to those results, the findings from the present study show that there is no difference in the sizes of the perceptual and grasp illusions if the perceptual and grasping tasks are appropriately matched. We show that the differences found previously can be accounted for by a hitherto unknown, nonadditive effect in the illusion. We conclude that the illusion does not provide evidence for the existence of two distinct pathways for perception and action in the visual system.},

The most common dissociation is between body schema to guide limb movements, and body image used to make perceptual judgements. In the current study we employed a kinaesthetic illusion in two experiments to dissociate body representations in healthy individuals. Tendon vibration creates an illusory lengthening of the muscle and an illusive displacement of the limb. In Experiment 1 two conditions were used. In the ‘direct’ condition the biceps of the dominant right arm of blindfolded participants was vibrated, creating illusory elbow extension. In the ‘indirect’ condition the right knee was held with the vibrated right arm, creating illusive lowering of the leg and knee. In both conditions, subjects performed with the non-vibrated arm a reaching as well as a matching response, theorized to be based on the body schema and body image, respectively. Results showed that the illusion was signiﬁcantly larger for the matching as compared to the reaching response, with the most pronounced difference observed in the direct condition. In Experiment 2 reaching and matching without vibration and a passive matching response were implemented in the direct condition. The same differential effect of the illusion was found. Results further showed that passive and active matching were statistically similar but signiﬁcantly different from the reaching response. In conclusion, these ﬁndings suggest that the effect of the kinaesthetic illusion on reaching and matching differed, consistent with the idea of separate underlying body representations for both responses.},

In the process, I review various theories of amodal symbols, their distortions of grounded theories, and fallacies in the evidence used to support them. Incorporating further contributions across articles, I then sketch a theoretical approach that I believe is likely to be successful, which includes grounding, abstraction, flexibility, explaining classic conceptual phenomena, and making contact with real-world situations. This account further proposes that (1) a key element of grounding is neural reuse, (2) abstraction takes the forms of multimodal compression, distilled abstraction, and distributed linguistic representation (but not amodal symbols), and (3) flexible context-dependent representations are a hallmark of conceptual processing.},

	abstract = {By using meaningful stimuli, multisensory research has recently started to investigate the impact of stimulus content on crossmodal integration. Variations in this respect have often been termed as “semantic”. In this paper we will review work related to the question for which tasks the influence of semantic factors has been found and which cortical networks are most likely to mediate these effects. More specifically, the focus of this paper will be on processing of object stimuli presented in the auditory and visual sensory modalities. Furthermore, we will investigate which cortical regions are particularly responsive to experimental variations of content by comparing semantically matching (“congruent”) and mismatching (“incongruent”) experimental conditions. In this context, recent neuroimaging studies point toward a possible functional differentiation of temporal and frontal cortical regions, with the former being more responsive to semantically congruent and the latter to semantically incongruent audio-visual (AV) stimulation. To account for these differential effects, we will suggest in the final section of this paper a possible synthesis of these data on semantic modulation of AV integration with findings from neuroimaging studies and theoretical accounts of semantic memory.},

	abstract = {Background—The human face and body are rich sources of socio-emotional cues. Accurate recognition of these cues is central to adaptive social functioning. Past studies indicate that individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits in the perception of emotion from facial cues but the contribution of bodily cues to social perception in schizophrenia is undetermined. The present study examined the detection of social cues from human gait patterns presented by computer-generated volumetric walking figures.
Method—A total of 22 SZ and 20 age-matched healthy control participants (CO) viewed 1 s movies of a ‘digital’ walker’s gait and subsequently made a forced-choice decision on the emotional state (angry or happy) or the gender of the walker presented at three intensity levels. Overall sensitivity to the social cues and bias were computed. For SZ, symptom severity was assessed.
Results—SZ were less sensitive than CO on both emotion and gender discrimination, regardless of intensity. While impaired overall, greater signal intensity did improve performance of SZ. Neither group differed in their response bias in either condition. The discrimination sensitivity of SZ was unrelated to their social functioning or symptoms but a bias toward perceiving gait as happy was associated with better social functioning.
Conclusions—These results suggest that SZ are impaired in extracting social information from gait but SZ benefited from increased signal intensity of social cues. Inaccurate perception of social cues in others may hinder adequate preparation for social interactions.},

	abstract = {Background: Mental disorders are among the most common health issues worldwide. Changes in psychomotor behavior can be observed in gross motor skills. Gait is an example of behavior that reflects various levels of nervous system function. In psychiatric conditions, gait disturbances are thought to reflect defective brain function. Patients who suffer from gait disturbances tend to develop balance disorders as well as impaired body posture.
Objective: The purpose of this review is to examine current knowledge regarding gait and related physical aspects (balance and posture) in patients suffering from depression, anxiety or schizophrenia, and to formulate recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Data Sources: A cross search was conducted in five databases, using the following keywords: body posture, balance, and gait. Each of these keywords was cross-referenced with specific mental illnesses: schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. Forty-eight suitable articles complying with criteria were chosen. Major Finding: Our review indicates that patients suffering from mental disorders have a unique physical profile that is in keeping with the clinical diagnosis (schizophrenia, depression and anxiety): the physical profile of patients with schizophrenia is characterized by a slow gait and decreased stride length, patients suffering from anxiety disorders are characterized by balance disorders, and those suffering from depression - by a slow gait and slumped posture.
Conclusions: We would propose that when seeking to create an evaluation and treatment program for patients with mental illness, specific elements such as balance, gait patterns and posture, should also be taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {Background: Current research suggests that elevated levels of anxiety have a negative impact on the regulation of balance. However, most studies to date examined only global balance performance, with little attention to the way body posture is organized in space and time. The aim of this study is to examine whether posturographic measures can reveal (sub)clinical balance deficits in children with high levels of anxiety.
Methods: We examined the spatio-temporal structure of the centre-of-pressure (COP) fluctuations in children with elevated levels of anxiety and a group of typically developing children while maintaining quiet stance on a force plate in various balance challenging conditions. Balance was challenged by adopting sensory manipulations (standing with eyes closed and/or standing on a foam surface) and using a cognitive manipulation (dual-tasking).
Results: Across groups, postural performance was strongly influenced by the sensory manipulations, and hardly by the cognitive manipulation. We also found that children with anxiety had overall more postural sway, and that their postural sway was overall less complex than sway of typically developing children. The postural differences between groups were present even in the simple baseline condition, and the group differences became larger with increasing task difficulty.
Conclusion: The pattern of postural sway suggests that balance is overall less stable and more attention demanding in children with anxiety than typically developing children. The findings provide further evidence for a neuro-behavioral link between psychopathology and the effectiveness of postural control.},

	abstract = {Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) are states during which people experience their centre of awareness as located outside of their physical body, along with the sensation of seeing the environment from an elevated viewpoint. OBE is encountered in epilepsy, migraine and depersonalization, and it is not an uncommon experience in the general population. Current neuroscientiﬁc models of bodily self-consciousness consider that OBE are related to a failure to integrate visual, somatosensory and vestibular signals. These models have highlighted the importance of visual-vestibular mismatch in OBE. Case reports from older clinical literature suggest that vestibular disorders may precipitate OBE, but we were lacking population-based evidence that OBE is related to vestibular disorders. The present observational, prospective study describes otoneurological, neuropsychological and phenomenological correlates of OBE in the largest sample of patients with dizziness to date (n ¼ 210) compared to a group of age- and gender-matched controls with no history of dizziness (n ¼ 210). We show a signiﬁcantly higher occurrence of OBE in patients with dizziness (14\%) than in healthy participants (5\%). Most of the patients experienced OBE only after they started having dizziness for the ﬁrst time. OBE in patients with dizziness were mainly related to peripheral vestibular disorders. We also identify depersonalization-derealization, depression and anxiety as the main predictors of OBE in patients with dizziness, as well as a contribution of migraine. Depersonalizationderealization was the only signiﬁcant predictor of OBE in healthy controls. Altogether, our data indicate that OBE in patients with dizziness may arise from a combination of perceptual incoherence evoked by the vestibular dysfunction with psychological factors (depersonalization-derealization, depression and anxiety) and neurological factors (migraine).},

We found that visuo-tactile stroking of a virtual body but not of a control object led to increased pressure pain thresholds and self-location. This increase was not modulated by the synchrony of stroking as predicted based on earlier work. This differed for self-identiﬁcation where we found as predicted that synchrony of stroking increased self-identiﬁcation with the virtual body (but not a control object), and positively correlated with an increase in pain thresholds. We discuss the functional mechanisms of self-identiﬁcation, self-location, and the visual perception of human bodies with respect to pain perception.},

In the present study we investigated whether audiotactile CCEs exist and, if so, whether these CCEs have similar characteristics to those found by previous authors with visual distractors. We measured audiotactile CCEs by attaching four vibrators to the backs of participants and presented auditory stimuli from four loudspeakers placed, in separate blocks, at different distances in front of or behind the participant’s body. Participants discriminated the elevation of tactile stimuli while ignoring the auditory distractors. CCEs were found only when participants were provided with noninformative vision of their own body, as seen from behind via a camera and head-mounted display; they were absent when participants did not view their body. Furthermore, in contrast to visuotactile CCEs, audiotactile CCEs did not depend on whether the distractors were presented on the same or different side as the tactile targets. The present study provides the ﬁrst demonstration of an audiotactile CCE: incongruent auditory distractors impaired performance on a tactile elevation discrimination task relative to performance with congruent distractors. We show that audiotactile CCEs differ from visuotactile CCEs as they do not appear to be as sensitive to the spatial relations between the distractors and the tactile stimuli. We also show that these CCEs are modulated by vision of the body.},

Such a proposal predicts that damage to these regions should disrupt or even abolish SA. We tested this prediction in a rare neurological patient with extensive bilateral brain damage encompassing the insula, ACC, mPFC, and the medial temporal lobes. In spite of severe amnesia, which partially affected his ‘‘autobiographical self’’, the patient’s SA remained fundamentally intact. His Core SA, including basic self-recognition and sense of self-agency, was preserved. His Extended SA and Introspective SA were also largely intact, as he has a stable self-concept and intact higher-order metacognitive abilities. The results suggest that the insular cortex, ACC and mPFC are not required for most aspects of SA. Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that SA is likely to emerge from more distributed interactions among brain networks including those in the brainstem, thalamus, and posteromedial cortices.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The neural substrates of states devoted to processing self-related information (“self-related states”) remain not fully elucidated. Besides the complexity of the problem, there is evidence suggesting that self-related states vary according to the information domain being considered. Here, we investigated brain correlates for self-related states concerning historical aspects of one’s life (autobiographical self), and one’s ongoing body status (core self). We focused on memory-related regions, body-related regions, CMSs (cortical midline structures), and ICs (insular cortices). Methods: This was a block-design fMRI study contrasting brain activity for core self (interoception and exteroception) and autobiographical self (personality traits and biographic facts) information domains. It involved 19 participants, who answered questions about each domain (four conditions). Results: All conditions appeared to engage the regions of interest. Nonetheless, autobiographical self compared with core self showed greater activity in memory-related regions (e.g., hippocampus), MPFC (medial prefrontal cortex), superior PMC (posteromedial cortex), and anterior ICs. Core self compared with autobiographical self was associated with greater activity in body-related regions (e.g., somatosensory cortices, and EBA [extrastriate body area]), superior PMC, and posterior ICs. In addition, (1) facts compared with traits showed greater activity in body-related regions, memoryrelated regions, MPFC, and PMC; (2) traits compared with facts were associated with greater activity in the posterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex; (3) interoception compared with exteroception was associated with greater activity in body-related regions (e.g. postcentral gyrus), memory-related regions, MPFC, inferior PMC and ICs; (4) exteroception compared with interoception showed greater activity in some body-related regions (e.g., premotor cortices and EBA) and superior PMC. Conclusions: The results support the notion that the neural correlates of self-related states depend on the information domain. Those states seem distinguishable in terms of activity in memory-related and body-related regions, and activity in regions that have been associated with self processes (CMSs and the ICs).},

This review systematically examines empirical research on puberty-related structural and functional brain development in humans, with the aim of identifying convergent patterns of associations. We emphasize longitudinal studies, and discuss pervasive but oft-overlooked methodological issues that may be contributing to inconsistent findings and hindering progress (e.g., conflating distinct pubertal indices and different measurement instruments). We also briefly evaluate support for prominent models of adolescent neurodevelopment that hypothesize pubertyrelated changes in brain regions involved in affective and motivational processes. For the field to progress, replication studies are needed to help resolve current inconsistencies and gain a clearer understanding of pubertal associations with brain development in humans, knowledge that is crucial to make sense of the changes in psychosocial functioning, risk behavior, and mental health during adolescence.},

Generally coming from the supposed failure of the Cartesian interactionist dualism, most philosophers of the mind adopt a physicalist ontology. However, according to Popper, this one seems to meet with insuperable diﬃculties: it can’t give physicalist explanation of rationality and freedom, of qualia; it can’t suggest a satisfactory explanation of the implementation of logical standards. That is why, as Popper explains in The Self and its Brain, materialistic theories of the mind turn into epiphenomenalism or eliminativism. Popper thinks that all these criticisms of materialism allow to conceive the possibility of spiritual nature of the mind.},

	abstract = {There is some evidence that disordered self-processing in autism spectrum disorders is linked to the social impairments characteristic of the condition. To investigate whether bodily self-consciousness is altered in autism spectrum disorders as a result of multisensory processing differences, we tested responses to the full body illusion and measured peripersonal space in 22 adults with autism spectrum disorders and 29 neurotypical adults. In the full body illusion set-up, participants wore a head-mounted display showing a view of their ‘virtual body’ being stroked synchronously or asynchronously with respect to felt stroking on their back. After stroking, we measured the drift in perceived self-location and selfidentification with the virtual body. To assess the peripersonal space boundary we employed an audiotactile reaction time task. The results showed that participants with autism spectrum disorders are markedly less susceptible to the full body illusion, not demonstrating the illusory self-identification and self-location drift. Strength of self-identification was negatively correlated with severity of autistic traits and contributed positively to empathy scores. The results also demonstrated a significantly smaller peripersonal space, with a sharper (steeper) boundary, in autism spectrum disorders participants. These results suggest that bodily self-consciousness is altered in participants with autism spectrum disorders due to differences in multisensory integration, and this may be linked to deficits in social functioning.},

We sought to investigate how age-related changes in self-appraisal processes corresponded with brain network segregation and integration in healthy adolescents and young adults. We scanned 88 participants (46 female), aged from 15 to 25 years, as they performed a self-appraisal task. We ﬁrst examined their patterns of activation to self-appraisal, and replicated prior reports of reduced dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation with older age, with similar reductions in precuneus, right anterior insula/operculum, and a region extending from thalamus to striatum. We used independent component analysis to identify distinct anterior and posterior components of the default mode network (DMN), which were associated with the self-appraisal and rest-ﬁxation parts of the task, respectively. Increasing age was associated with reduced functional connectivity between the two components. Finally, analyses of task-evoked interactions between pairs of nodes within the DMN identiﬁed a subnetwork that demonstrated reduced connectivity with increasing age. Decreased network integration within the DMN appears to be an important higher-order maturational process supporting the emerging adult self.},

	abstract = {Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a uniﬁed science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.},

	abstract = {Background: In rubber hand illusions and full body illusions, touch sensations are projected to non-body objects such as rubber hands, dolls or virtual bodies. The robustness, limits and further perceptual consequences of such illusions are not yet fully explored or understood. A number of experiments are reported that test the limits of a variant of the rubber hand illusion.
Methodology/Principal Findings: A variant of the rubber hand illusion is explored, in which the real and foreign hands are aligned in personal space. The presence of the illusion is ascertained with participants’ scores and temperature changes of the real arm. This generates a basic illusion of touch projected to a foreign arm. Participants are presented with further, unusual visuotactile stimuli subsequent to onset of the basic illusion. Such further visuotactile stimulation is found to generate very unusual experiences of supernatural touch and touch on a non-hand object. The finding of touch on a nonhand object conflicts with prior findings, and to resolve this conflict a further hypothesis is successfully tested: that without prior onset of the basic illusion this unusual experience does not occur.
Conclusions/Significance: A rubber hand illusion is found that can arise when the real and the foreign arm are aligned in personal space. This illusion persists through periods of no tactile stimulation and is strong enough to allow very unusual experiences of touch felt on a cardboard box and experiences of touch produced at a distance, as if by supernatural causation. These findings suggest that one’s visual body image is explained away during experience of the illusion and they may be of further importance to understanding the role of experience in delusion formation. The findings of touch on nonhand objects may help reconcile conflicting results in this area of research. In addition, new evidence is provided that relates to the recently discovered psychologically induced temperature changes that occur during the illusion.},

Here we designed a novel paradigm linking the study of bodily self-consciousness to the spatial representation of visuo-tactile stimuli by measuring crossmodal congruency effects (CCEs) for the full body.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured full body CCEs by attaching four vibrator-light pairs to the trunks (backs) of subjects who viewed their bodies from behind via a camera and a head mounted display (HMD). Subjects made speeded elevation (up/down) judgments of the tactile stimuli while ignoring light stimuli. To modulate self-identification for the seen body subjects were stroked on their backs with a stick and the felt stroking was either synchronous or asynchronous with the stroking that could be seen via the HMD. We found that (1) tactile stimuli were mislocalized towards the seen body (2) CCEs were modulated systematically during visual-somatosensory conflict when subjects viewed their body but not when they viewed a body-sized object, i.e. CCEs were larger during synchronous than during asynchronous stroking of the body and (3) these changes in the mapping of tactile stimuli were induced in the same experimental condition in which predictable changes in bodily self-consciousness occurred.
Conclusions/Significance: These data reveal that systematic alterations in the mapping of tactile stimuli occur in a full body illusion and thus establish CCE magnitude as an online performance proxy for subjective changes in global bodily selfconsciousness.},

	abstract = {Objective: Chronic pain is common in paediatric populations and many patients do not respond to the currently available evidence-based treatments. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have a growing evidence-base in adults, but evidence is limited in youth with chronic pain.
Methods: We conducted an open-label pilot study to test the feasibility of an 8-week MBI for this population.
Results: Seven adolescents (age range 14–17; median age 15; six female) completed the intervention. There were no dropouts. Median class attendance was seven of eight total sessions (SD = 0.76). Only one (14.3\%) participant reported not finding it useful; five (71.4\%) reported that they would recommend it to a friend; and the remaining two (28.6\%) reported “maybe”. There was no worsening of internalizing symptoms. Secondary outcomes included significant reduction of pain intensity, which was maintained at three-month follow-up. Somatic symptoms and functional disability were both non-significantly lower immediately following the intervention; but were significantly improved at three-month follow-up.
Conclusion: An eight-week group MBI is a feasible intervention for adolescents with chronic pain, and warrants further investigation as a potential alternative to cognitive behavioural therapy in this population.},

FH+Pain youth had widespread reductions in brain activity within limbic and visual processing regions during processing of positively valenced emotional stimuli, as well as reduced fronto-parietal response while processing negatively valenced emotional stimuli compared with their peers. Additionally, during inhibition within a positive emotional context, FH+Pain youth had reduced cognitive control and salience-related brain activity. On the other hand, default mode-related brain response was elevated during inhibitory control within a negative emotional context in these adolescents compared with their peers (p/α {\textless} 0.05). The current findings indicate differences in both emotional processing and cognitive control brain response in FH+Pain compared with FH−Pain youth, suggesting that both affective and executive functioning pathways may be important markers related to the intergenerational transmission of pain.},

	abstract = {A historical review of the concepts of self-consciousness is presented, highlighting the important role of the body (particularly, body perception but also body action), and the social other in the construction of self-consciousness. More precisely, body perception, especially intermodal sensory perception including kinesthetic perception, is involved in the construction of a sense of self allowing self-other differentiation. Furthermore, the social other, through very early social and emotional interactions, provides meaning to the infant’s perception and contributes to the development of his/her symbolization capacities. This is a necessary condition for body image representation and awareness of a permanent self in a time-space continuum (invariant over time and space). Self-image recognition impairments in the mirror are also discussed regarding a comprehensive developmental theory of self-consciousness. Then, a neuropsychological and neurophysiological approach to self-consciousness reviews the role of complex brain activation/integration pathways and the mirror neuron system in self-consciousness. Finally, this article offers new perspectives on self-consciousness evaluation using a double mirror paradigm to study self- and otherimage and body recognition.},

In this study we explored whether this effect: (i) acts on implicit mechanisms in modifying one’s body-size perception, (ii) is body-exposure-specific also at the implicit level, and (iii) is modulated by interoceptive sensibility. We assigned a covert attention task to 100 women, exposing them to extreme-sized bodies (thin and fat) or extreme-sized objects (thin and fat bottles). Before and after the attentional exposure, we tested the association between the “self/others” and “thin/fat” concepts using an Implicit Association Test. We also collected a measure of interoceptive sensibility by means of a self-report questionnaire. Results showed that participants exposed to fat bodies implicitly presented a stronger association between the “self” and “thin” concepts. This association was significantly weaker in the group exposed to thin bodies. This effect was absent after exposure to thin and fat bottles. Notably, participants with a higher tolerance of negative bodily interoceptive signals were less susceptible to the malleability of body image exerted by the exposure attentional task. Our findings shed new light on the relationship between the perception of internal (e.g., visceral) and external (e.g., visual) signals in the representation of our body.},

Body-size overestimation is associated with body dissatisfaction, anxiety, depression, and the development of eating disorders in individuals who desire to be thinner. Similar symptoms have been noted for those who underestimate their muscularity. Conversely, individuals with high body mass indices (BMI) who underestimate their adiposity may not recognize the risks of or seek help for obesity-related medical issues. Although social scientists have examined whether media representations of idealized bodies contribute to the overestimation of fat or underestimation of muscle, other scientists suggest that increases in the prevalence of obesity could explain body-fat underestimation as a form of renormalization. However, these disparate approaches have not advanced our understanding of the perceptual underpinnings of BSSM. Recently, a new unifying account of BSSM has emerged that is based on the long-established phenomenon of visual adaptation, employing psychophysical measurements of perceived size and shape following exposure to “extreme” body stimuli. By inducing BSSM in the laboratory as an aftereffect, this technique is rapidly advancing our understanding of the underlying mental representation of human bodies. This nascent approach provides insight into real-world BSSM and may inform the development of therapeutic and public-health interventions designed to address such perceptual errors.},

Here, we conducted two experiments investigating the effect of rotating the orientation of the test stimuli by 90° from that of the adaptor. Aftereffects were maximal when adapting and test bodies had the same orientation. When they differed, the axis of the perceived distortion changed with the orientation of the body. Experiment 1 demonstrated a 58\% transfer of the aftereffect across orientations. Experiment 2 demonstrated an even greater degree of aftereffect transfer when the influence of low-level mechanisms was reduced further by using adaptation and test stimuli with different sizes. These results indicate that the body aftereffect is mediated primarily by high-level object-based processes, with low-level retinotopic mechanisms playing only a minor role. The influence of these low-level processes is further reduced when test stimuli differ in size from adaptation stimuli.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW The experience of ourselves as an embodied agent with a firstperson perspective is referred to as ’bodily self’. We present a selective overview of relevant clinical and experimental studies. RECENT FINDINGS Sharing multisensory body space with others can be observed in patients with structurally altered bodies (amputations, congenital absence of limbs), with altered functionality after hemiplegia, such as denial of limb ownership (somatoparaphrenia) and with alterations in bodily self-consciousness on the level of the entire body (e.g. in autoscopic phenomena). In healthy participants, the mechanisms underpinning body ownership and observer perspective are empirically investigated by multisensory stimulation paradigms to alter the bodily self. The resulting illusions have promoted the understanding of complex disturbances of the bodily self, such as out-ofbody experiences. We discuss the role of interoception in differentiating between self and others and review current advances in the study of body integrity identity disorder, a condition shaped as much by neurological as by social-psychological factors. SUMMARY We advocate a social neuroscience approach to the bodily self that takes into account the interactions between body, mind and society and might help close the divide between neurology and psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Interoceptive and exteroceptive information are both essential for the construction and update of self-awareness. Whereas several studies have shown how interoceptive accuracy or cardiac feedback influences body-awareness, no studies have looked at the reverse effect, namely how exteroceptively-driven changes in body-ownership and self-identification can influence individuals’ ability to detect internal bodily signals. We exposed participants to the Rubber Hand Illusion (Experiment 1) and to the Enfacement Illusion (Experiment 2), and tested how this change in the sense of body-ownership and self-identification affected their interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). The heartbeat-counting task was used to measure IAcc before the bodily illusions, and then the same task was interleaved with periods of visuo-tactile stimulation, during which synchronous and asynchronous multisensory stimulation was applied. We found that a change in body-ownership significantly improved performance of participants with lower interoceptive accuracy. In contrast, a change in self-identification significantly decreased performance of participants with higher interoceptive accuracy. These results suggest that changes in different domains of self-awareness can differentially impact individuals’ ability to accurately detect signals arising from within the body, highlighting the distinct role that interoceptive signals play for different facets of bodily self-consciousness.},

When athletes simulate only dynamic phases of movement or perform MI just before competing, however, environmental and time constraints lead to an underestimation of actual duration. Conversely, complex attentiondemanding movements take longer to image. Finally, participants can modify the speed of MI voluntarily when they receive specific instructions. To complete the available data, the authors compared imagined and actual durations in tennis and gymnastics. Results showed systematic and disproportionate overestimation of actual duration. The authors found a relationship between complex motor skills and MI duration. They discuss the factors leading to over- and underestimation and the hypotheses that could be tested.},

The visually-guided pointing task was used to investigate the speed for accuracy trade-offs that occur as target size is varied for both real and imagined performance. The task was performed both with and without an external load of 2 kg. For the no-load condition and load conditions, the speed for accuracy trade-off for both real and imagined performance conformed to Fitts’ law. Movement durations of real movements remained largely unaffected by the addition of the load, however, movement durations of imagined movements increased signiﬁcantly with the addition of the load.

	abstract = {Objective: Although body-image disturbance is among the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, the nature and extent of this disturbance have not been precisely identiﬁed. This is the purpose of this ﬁrst meta-analysis of extant research on body image and eating disorders. Method: Using contemporary techniques, the meta-analysis systematically examined 66 studies (from 1974 to 1993) of perceptual and attitudinal parameters of body image among anorexics and bulimics relative to control groups. Results: Attitudinal body dissatisfaction, both questionnaire and self-ideal discrepancy measures, produced substantially larger effect sizes than did perceptual size-estimation inaccuracy. Body dissatisfaction measures, whether global or weight/shape related, differentiated bulimic and anorexic groups (with bulimics having more dissatisfaction), whereas perceptual distortion indices did not. Somewhat larger effects occurred with whole-body than with body-part size-estimation assessments. Size distortion among patients with eating disorders appears unlikely to reﬂect a more generalized sensory/perceptual deﬁcit. Discussion: Scientiﬁc, conceptual, and clinical implications of these ﬁndings are delineated. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Eat Disord 22: 107–125, 1997.},

This target article uses as an example a form of reasoning about a function of "consciousness" based on the phenomenon of blindsight. Some information about stimuli in the blind field is represented in the brains of blindsight patients, as shown by their correct "guesses." They cannot harness this information in the service ofaction, however, and this is said to show that a function of phenomenal consciousness is somehow to enable information represented in the brain to guide action. But stimuli in the blind field are both access-unconscious and phenomenally unconscious. The fallacy is: an obvious function of the machinery of accessconsciousness is illicitly transferred to phenomenal consciousness.},

In other words, people will perceive the tool as a part of their body, and thus feel like they have “longer limbs” after using tools. However, it is unclear whether tool embodiment could spread to a limb that is not using the tool, and whether other limbs could utilize the proprioception of a limb. In Experiment 1, blindfolded participants were asked to search with a cane (Condition 1) or to walk with a cane (Condition 2). The results in Condition 1 illustrated that the tactile distance perception on the forearm was lengthened after tool use, while other body parts did not signiﬁcantly change. In Condition 2, the tactile distance perception on the hand and forearm extended signiﬁcantly after using tools. Additionally, tool-use training even induced an increased perception of the calf that was not using the tool. Possible interference from the difference between walking and standing was excluded in Experiment 2. These results demonstrate that the proprioception information of one limb could be exploited by another limb to extend the body schema even though that limb was not using a tool. It was also observed that the effect of direction was task-dependent in the tactile perception task.},

	abstract = {Episodic memory (EM) is classically conceived as a memory for events, localized in space and time, and characterized by autonoetic consciousness (ANC) allowing to mentally travel back in time and subjectively relive an event. Building on recent evidence that the ﬁrst-person visual co-perception of one’s own body during encoding impacts EM, we used a scene recognition task in immersive virtual reality (VR) and measured how ﬁrst-person body view would modulate peri-encoding resting-state fMRI, EM performance, and ANC. Speciﬁcally, we investigated the impact of body view on post-encoding functional connectivity in an a priori network of regions related either to EM or multisensory bodily processing and used these regions in a seed-to-whole brain analysis. Postencoding connectivity between the right hippocampus (rHC) and right parahippocampus (rPHC) was enhanced when participants encoded scenes while seeing their body. Moreover, the strength of connectivity between the rHC, rPHC and the neocortex displayed two main patterns with respect to body view. The connectivity with a sensorimotor fronto-parietal network, comprising primary somatosensory and primary motor cortices, correlated with ANC after - but not before - encoding, depending on body view. The opposite change of connectivity was found between rHC, rPHC and the medial parietal cortex (from being correlated with ANC before encoding to an absence of correlation after encoding), but irrespective of body view. Linking immersive VR and fMRI for the study of EM and ANC, these ﬁndings suggest that seeing one’s own body during encoding impacts the brain activity related to EM formation by modulating the connectivity between the right hippocampal formation and the neocortical regions involved in the processing of multisensory bodily signals and self-consciousness.},

	abstract = {Interoception – the process of sensing bodily signals – has gained much interest in recent years, due to its role in physical and mental well-being. Here, we focus on the role of interoception in social connection, which is a relatively new and growing research area. Studies in this area suggest that interoception may help in appraising physiological signals in social situations, but also that (challenging) social situations may reduce interoceptive processing by shifting attention from internally- to externally- focused. We discuss potential mechanisms for the inﬂuence of interoception on social connection and highlight that ﬂexibility in engaging interoception in social situations may be particularly important. We end with a discussion of loneliness –an extreme case of poor social connection, which is associated with physiological decline and increased mortality risk, and propose that interoceptive dysregulation is involved. We suggest that interventions aimed to improve interoceptive abilities, such as mindfulness-based meditation practices, may be key for alleviating loneliness and improving social connection.},

	abstract = {Over the course of a century, the meaning of interoception has changed from the restrictive to the inclusive. In its inclusive sense, it bears relevance to every individual via its link to emotion, decision making, time-perception, health, pain, and various other areas of life. While the label for the perception of the body state changes over time, the need for an overarching concept remains. Many aspects can make any particular interoceptive sensation unique and distinct from any other interoceptive sensation. This can range from the sense of agency, to the physical cause of a sensation, the ontogenetic origin, the efferent innervation, and afferent pathways of the tissue involved amongst others. In its overarching meaning, interoception primarily is a product of the central nervous system, a construct based on an integration of various sources, not per se including afferent information. This paper proposes a deﬁnition of interoception as based on subjective experience, and pleas for the use of speciﬁc vocabulary in addressing the many aspects that contribute to it.},

Study 2 (N = 327) cross-validated its unidimensionality. Study 3 (N = 424) further upheld the construct validity of the BAS, as it was: (a) related as expected to appearance evaluation, body preoccupation, body dissatisfaction, and eating disorder symptomatology and (b) unrelated to impression management. Studies 1 and 3 also indicated that the BAS predicted unique variance in psychological well-being above and beyond extant measures of body image. Study 4 (N = 177) demonstrated that its scores were stable over a 3-week period. All studies supported the internal consistency reliability of its scores.

	abstract = {Recurrent pains are a complex set of conditions that cause great discomfort and impairment in children and adults. The objectives of this study were to (a) describe the frequency of headache, stomachache, and backache in a representative Canadian adolescent sample and (b) determine whether a set of psychosocial factors, including background factors (i.e., sex, pubertal status, parent chronic pain), external events (i.e., injury, illness/hospitalization, stressful-life events), and emotional factors (i.e., anxiety/depression, self-esteem) were predictive of these types of recurrent pain. Statistics Canada’s National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth was used to assess a cohort of 2488 10- to 11-year-old adolescents up to ﬁve times, every 2 years. Results showed that, across 12–19 years of age, weekly or more frequent rates ranged from 26.1\%–31.8\% for headache, 13.5–22.2\% for stomachache, and 17.6–25.8\% for backache. Chi-square tests indicated that girls had higher rates of pain than boys for all types of pain, at all time points. Structural equation modeling using latent growth curves showed that sex and anxiety/depression at age 10–11 years was predictive of the start- and end-point intercepts (i.e., trajectories that indicated high levels of pain across time) and/or slopes (i.e., trajectories of pain that increased over time) for all three types of pain. Although there were also other factors that predicted only certain pain types or certain trajectory types, overall the results of this study suggest that adolescent recurrent pain is very common and that psychosocial factors can predict trajectories of recurrent pain over time across adolescence.},

Results The results reveal a significant and positive association between SPA and the DEAB scales. Furthermore, they show a positive relationship between SPA and (a) vomitingpurging behaviors in adolescents involved in individual sports and (b) generic DEAB (i.e., a subscale covering fear of getting fat, food preoccupation, and eating-related guilt), particularly in adolescents involved in individual sports.
Conclusion The relationship between SPA and DEAB does not differ according to adolescents’ involvement in sport practice or according to their involvement in organized, competitive, or leanness sport practice more specifically. However, higher levels of SPA and DEAB were observed in adolescents involved in individual sports.},

Random stratified samples, drawn from a national survey, included 1,064 females and 988 males. In order to evaluate the replicability of the BSRQ factor structure, separate split-sample factor analyses (principal components with varimax rotation) were conducted for each sex. Largely consistent with the conceptual basis of the BSRQ, the resultant factors derived from each analysis were: Appearance Evaluation, Appearance Orientation, Fitness Evaluation, Fitness Orientation, Health Evaluation, Health Orientation, and Illness Orientation. Subsequent concordance analyses revealed marked stability of the factor structure both within and between sexes. Females demonstrated somewhat greater differentiation of body-image attitudes than did males. The utility of the BSRQ is discussed relative to extant body-image measures.},

All over the world scientists, psychologists, and philosophers are waiting to read Antonio Damasio's new theory of the nature of consciousness and the construction of the self. A renowned and revered scientist and clinician, Damasio has spent decades following amnesiacs down hospital corridors, waiting for comatose patients to awaken, and devising ingenious research using PET scans to piece together the great puzzle of consciousness. In his bestselling Descartes' Error, Damasio revealed the critical importance of emotion in the making of reason. Building on this foundation, he now shows how consciousness is created. Consciousness is the feeling of what happens-our mind noticing the body's reaction to the world and responding to that experience. Without our bodies there can be no consciousness, which is at heart a mechanism for survival that engages body, emotion, and mind in the glorious spiral of human life. A hymn to the possibilities of human existence, a magnificent work of ingenious science, a gorgeously written book, The Feeling of What Happens is already being hailed as a classic.},

	shorttitle = {The embodied mind},
	abstract = {This classic book, first published in 1991, was one of the first to propose the “embodied cognition” approach in cognitive science. It pioneered the connections between phenomenology and science and between Buddhist practices and science-claims that have since become highly influential. Through this cross-fertilization of disparate fields of study, The Embodied Mind introduced a new form of cognitive science called “enaction," in which both the environment and first person experience are aspects of embodiment. However, enactive embodiment is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by a brain, a mind, or a self; rather it is the bringing forth of an interdependent world in and through embodied action. Although enacted cognition lacks an absolute foundation, the book shows how that does not lead to either experiential or philosophical nihilism. Above all, the book’s arguments were powered by the conviction that the sciences of mind must encompass lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience. This revised edition includes substantive introductions by Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch that clarify central arguments of the work and discuss and evaluate subsequent research that has expanded on the themes of the book, including the renewed theoretical and practical interest in Buddhism and mindfulness. A preface by Jon Kabat-Zinn, the originator of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program, contextualizes the book and describes its influence on his life and work. © 1991, 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

	abstract = {An altered sense of one's own body is a common consequence of vestibular damage, and also of damage to vestibular networks in the right hemisphere. However, few experimental studies have investigated whether vestibular signals contribute to bodily awareness. We addressed this issue by combining an established experimental model of bodily awareness (Rubber Hand Illusion -RHI) with galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in healthy participants. Brief left anodal and right cathodal GVS (which predominantly activates vestibular networks in the right hemisphere), or right anodal and left cathodal GVS, or sham stimulation were delivered at random, while participants experienced either synchronous or asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation of a rubber hand and their own hand. The drift in the perceived position of the participant’s hand towards the rubber hand was used as a proxy measure of the resulting multisensory illusion of body ownership. GVS induced strong polarity-dependent effects on this measure of RHI: left anodal and right cathodal GVS produced significantly lower proprioceptive drift than right anodal and left cathodal GVS. We suggest that vestibular inputs influence the multisensory weighting functions that underlie bodily awareness: the right hemisphere vestibular projections activated by the left anodal and right cathodal GVS increased the weight of intrinsic proprioceptive signals about hand position, and decreased the weight of visual information responsible for visual capture during the RHI.},

Cela ne se fait ni en un jour ni par la grâce d’une génération spontanée. L’objectif le plus ambitieux de cet ouvrage, qui fête ses 35 ans et accueille de nouveaux collaborateurs, est d’apporter à chaque professionnel au contact d’adolescents en difficulté les connaissances et les repères lui permettant de répondre au mieux à cette priorité. »Daniel Marcelli, Alain BraconnierÀ l’occasion de cette 9e édition, la structure a été entièrement remaniée avec l’ajout de nombreux nouveaux chapitres. L’ouvrage se présente désormais sous 4 grandes parties : les bases théoriques et généralités, les grands regroupements syndromiques (approche nosographique et psychopathologie des conduites), l’adolescent dans son environnement et enfin la thérapeutique.

	abstract = {La construction sociale du corps  Tantôt perçu comme le siège de l'identité, où s'incarnerait le portrait moral et social de l'individu, tantôt comme une enveloppe emprisonnant l'âme ou l'esprit, le corps est la charnière de deux concepts clés de la pensée occidentale, la nature et la culture. Support obligé de toutes les activités de l'individu, le corps est mis en jeu dans les interactions avec autrui, le travail, le sport, la santé, mais aussi dans les pratiques les plus intimes, l'hygiène, l'alimentation ou la sexualité.  Ce livre tente d'articuler et de problématiser les réflexions que le corps a suscitées pour faire émerger une approche sociologique de cet objet paradoxal. Il interroge les représentations et les valeurs que le corps véhicule, les expressions du langage et les savoirs qui le façonnent, en particulier ses aspects les plus " naturels " et les plus personnels, de la façon de marcher à la manière de se moucher, de celle de se tenir à celle de se vêtir.

On invoque fréquemment la " dictature de la minceur ", les représentations médiatiques du corps féminin, les transformations des comportements alimentaires, pour expliquer la multiplication des cas d'anorexie chez les adolescentes. Plus généralement, l'anorexie est très souvent étudiée à travers les discours médicaux, psychanalytiques ou journalistiques qui détiennent sur ce sujet une sorte de " monopole de la parole légitime ". Muriel Darmon a choisi, au contraire, de se tenir au plus près de l'expérience des personnes concernées par la maladie, de leurs propriétés sociales et culturelles, et s'efforce de reconstituer précisément les conduites et les processus qui font que des adolescentes en viennent à être diagnostiquées comme anorexiques. À partir d'entretiens avec des jeunes filles anorexiques hospitalisées ou non, avec leurs enseignants et avec des adolescentes du même âge, elle montre que l'anorexie peut être décrite comme un véritable " travail ", une entreprise de transformation de soi qui requiert des dispositions spécifiques et qui s'organise en différentes phases composant une " carrière " anorexique, depuis l'engagement dans un régime jusqu'aux effets de l'hospitalisation et à la sortie de la maladie.},

	abstract = {Two studies were conducted to assess appearance-related visual processing mechanisms in populations at risk of disorders characterized by body image disturbance. Using inverted stimuli, Experiment 1 assessed visual processing mechanisms associated with body, face, and house viewing in adolescents. Experiment 2 applied the same protocol to assess appearance-related configural processing in high- and low-risk adolescent women, and women recovering from disorders characterized by body image disturbance. Experiment 1 found evidence for typical configural face and body processing, although adolescent women reported higher levels of body image concern (BIC) and self-objectified to a greater extent than adolescent men. In Experiment 2, typical body inversion effects were seen in the low-risk group, whilst there was some evidence to suggest a disruption to the configural processing of body stimuli in high-risk adolescents and in women recovering from body image disorders. Women in recovery were also quicker to respond to all stimuli, whilst high-risk adolescents took longer to respond to bodies than to other stimuli. Configural face processing was intact in all groups, and effects did not directly relate to BIC or self-objectification. These findings have implications for future research looking to inform early interventions and treatment, suggesting that there could be a tendency to visually process individual body parts at the expense of the whole-body form in women at risk of developing body image disorders, as well as those in recovery.},

	url = {https://psyarxiv.com/f2b36/},
	abstract = {How do we ‘see’ ourselves in our mind’s eye? The question of how we represent our self has been at the centre of cultural practices across centuries, as the long tradition of self-portraits attests, and at the centre of our understanding of mental health issues such as body-image disorders. By implementing a reverse-correlation technique to measure self-representations, we were able to visualise participants’ mental images of both their faces and their body-shapes in a data-driven, unconstrained way, allowing us to visually depict how the self is ‘seen’ in our minds. Our technique was successful, revealing ‘self-portraits’ which were strikingly accurate. However, importantly, we discovered that the facial features of the self-portraits also contained ‘clues’ to each person’s self-reported personality traits, which were reliably detected by external observers.  Finally, the higher the participants’ self-esteem with regards to social interactions, the more accurate and true-to-life their self-portraits were. Unlike the facial self-portraits, the body-shape portraits had negligible direct relationships with individuals’ actual body shape, but as with faces, they were significantly influenced by people’s beliefs and emotions; individuals with lower body self-esteem visually represented their bodies as wider. Together, our findings show how psychological beliefs and attitudes about one’s self bias the perceptual representation of one’s appearance, and provide a unique revealing window to into the internal mental representation of one’s self, with important implications for mental health and visual culture.},

	shorttitle = {Gait, {Balance} and {Posture} in {Major} {Mental} {Illnesses}},
	abstract = {Background: Mental disorders are among the most common health issues worldwide. Changes in psychomotor behavior can be observed in gross motor skills. Gait is an example of behavior that reflects various levels of nervous system function. In psychiatric conditions, gait disturbances are thought to reflect defective brain function. Patients who suffer from gait disturbances tend to develop balance disorders as well as impaired body posture.
Objective: The purpose of this review is to examine current knowledge regarding gait and related physical aspects (balance and posture) in patients suffering from depression, anxiety or schizophrenia, and to formulate recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Data Sources: A cross search was conducted in five databases, using the following keywords: body posture, balance, and gait. Each of these keywords was cross-referenced with specific mental illnesses: schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. Forty-eight suitable articles complying with criteria were chosen. Major Finding: Our review indicates that patients suffering from mental disorders have a unique physical profile that is in keeping with the clinical diagnosis (schizophrenia, depression and anxiety): the physical profile of patients with schizophrenia is characterized by a slow gait and decreased stride length, patients suffering from anxiety disorders are characterized by balance disorders, and those suffering from depression - by a slow gait and slumped posture.
Conclusions: We would propose that when seeking to create an evaluation and treatment program for patients with mental illness, specific elements such as balance, gait patterns and posture, should also be taken into consideration},

	abstract = {We take the feeling that our body belongs to us for granted. However, recent research has shown that it is possible to alter the subjective sensation of body ownership (BO) by manipulating multisensory bodily inputs. Several frontal and parietal regions are known to speciﬁcally process multisensory cues presented close to the body, i.e., within the peripersonal space (PPS). It has been proposed that these PPS fronto-parietal regions also underlie BO. However, most previous studies investigated the brain mechanisms of either BO or of PPS processing separately and by using a variety of paradigms. Here, we conducted an extensive meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies to investigate PPS and BO processing in humans in order to: a) assess quantitatively where each one of these functions was individually processed in the brain; b) identify whether and where these processes shared common or engaged distinct brain mechanisms; c) characterize these areas in terms of whole-brain co-activation networks and functions, respectively. We identiﬁed (i) a bilateral PPS network including superior parietal, temporo-parietal and ventral premotor regions and (ii) a BO network including posterior parietal cortex (right intraparietal sulcus, IPS; and left IPS and superior parietal lobule, SPL), right ventral premotor cortex, and the left anterior insula. Co-activation maps related to both PPS and BO encompassed largely overlapping fronto-parietal networks, but whereas the PPS network was more frequently associated with sensorimotor tasks, the BO network was rather associated with attention and awareness tasks. Finally, the conjunction analysis showed that (iii) PPS and BO tasks anatomically overlapped only in two clusters located in the left parietal cortex (dorsally at the intersection between the SPL, the IPS and area 2 and ventrally between areas 2 and IPS). Distinct activations were located for PPS at the temporo-parietal junction and for BO in the anterior insula. These results in PPS and BO and provide evidence-based insight about the overlap of the two processes in the IPS region and the extensive connectivity between the two associated coactivation networks. They also show signiﬁcant dissociations, with PPS fronto-parietal areas located more proximal to the central sulcus than BO areas. Such anatomical distinction may also reﬂect the diﬀerent functions of the two processes, whereby PPS areas underlie a multisensory-motor interface for body-objects interaction and BO areas being involved in bodily awareness and self-consciousness.},

Brain-body interactions have traditionally been associated with emotion, effort, or stress, but not with the “cold” processes of perception and attention. Here, we review recent experimental evidence suggesting a different picture: the neural monitoring of bodily state, and in particular the neural monitoring of the heart, affects visual perception. The impact of spontaneous ﬂuctuations of neural responses to heartbeats on visual detection is as large as the impact of explicit manipulations of spatial attention in perceptual tasks. However, we propose that the neural monitoring of visceral inputs plays a speciﬁc role in conscious perception, distinct from the role of attention. The neural monitoring of organs such as the heart or the gut would generate a subject-centered reference frame, from which the ﬁrst-person perspective inherent to conscious perception can develop. In this view, conscious perception results from the integration of visual content with ﬁrst-person perspective.},

Here, we ask whether it is possible to alter implicit racial attitudes by experimentally increasing self-other bodily overlap. Employing a bodily illusion known as the ‘Rubber Hand Illusion’, we delivered multisensory stimulation to light-skinned Caucasian participants to induce the feeling that a dark-skinned hand belonged to them. We then measured whether this could change their implicit racial biases against people with dark skin. Across two experiments, the more intense the participants’ illusion of ownership over the dark-skinned rubber hand, the more positive their implicit racial attitudes became. Importantly, it was not the pattern of multisensory stimulation per se, but rather, it was the change in the subjective experience of body ownership that altered implicit attitudes. These ﬁndings suggest that inducing an overlap between the bodies of self and other through illusory ownership is an effective way to change and reduce negative implicit attitudes towards outgroups.},

It is then approached via the theory of psychoanalytic technique, with papers that focus on boundaries and intimacy and on "Surface, Depth, and the Isolated Mind". And it culminates in two case studies that elicit animated discussion delineating different perspectives - intersubjective, motivational systems, and self-selfobject - on the self in relation to the therapeutic process. Two studies comparing Melanie Klein and Heinz Kohut; a discussion of how current cultural attitudes affect parenting; a relational view of the therapeutic partnership; and an integration of Silvan Tomkin's affect theory with self psychology add breadth to this timely and provocative collection. Volume 15 includes additional letters from the Kohut Archives and a moving account of Kohut's struggle with his own impending death.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of avatars (i.e. the virtual representation of the user in a virtual environment) in virtual reality, it is important to identify the factors eliciting the sense of embodiment or the factors that can disrupt this feeling. This paper reports an exploratory study aiming at identifying internal factors (personality traits and body awareness) that might cause either a resistance or a predisposition to feel a sense of embodiment towards a virtual avatar. To this purpose, we conducted an experiment (n=123) in which participants were immersed in a virtual environment and embodied in a gender-matched generic virtual avatar through a head-mounted display. After an exposure phase in which they had to perform a number of visuomotor tasks (during 2 minutes) a virtual character entered the virtual scene and stabbed the participants’ virtual hand with a knife. The participants’ sense of embodiment was measured, as well as several personality traits (Big Five traits and locus of control) and body awareness, to evaluate the inﬂuence of participants’ personality on the acceptance of the virtual body. The major ﬁnding of the experiment is that the locus of control is linked to several components of embodiment: the sense of agency is positively correlated with an internal locus of control and the sense of body ownership is positively correlated with an external locus of control. Interestingly, both components are not inﬂuenced by the same traits, which conﬁrms that they can appear independently. Taken together our results suggest that the locus of control could be a good predictor of the sense of embodiment when the user embodies an avatar with a similar physical appearance. Yet, further studies are required to conﬁrm these results.},

We found that during the illusion, the participants rated their own personality characteristics more similarly to the way they previously rated their friend’s personality, and this ﬂexible adjustment of self-concept to the ‘‘new’’ bodily self was related to the strength of illusory ownership of the friend’s body. Moreover, a subsequent memory test showed that personality traits rated during the friend-body-swap illusion were generally remembered worse than traits rated during the control conditions; importantly, however, this impairment of episodic recognition memory was reduced for the participants who considerably adjusted their self-concept during the illusory body swapping. These ﬁndings demonstrate that our beliefs about own personality are dynamically shaped by the perception of our body and that coherence between the bodily and conceptual self-representations is important for the normal encoding of episodic memories.},

	abstract = {To date, research on the development of emotion recognition has been dominated by studies on facial expression interpretation; very little is known about children’s ability to recognize affective meaning from body movements. In the present study, we acquired simultaneous video and motion capture recordings of two actors portraying four basic emotions (Happiness Sadness, Fear and Anger). One hundred and seven primary and secondary school children (aged 4–17) and 14 adult volunteers participated in the study. Each participant viewed the full-light and point-light video clips and was asked to make a forced-choice as to which emotion was being portrayed. As a group, children performed worse than adults for both point-light and full-light conditions. Linear regression showed that both age and lighting condition were significant predictors of performance in children. Using piecewise regression, we found that a bilinear model with a steep improvement in performance until 8.5 years of age, followed by a much slower improvement rate through late childhood and adolescence best explained the data. These findings confirm that, like for facial expression, adolescents’ recognition of basic emotions from body language is not fully mature and seems to follow a non-linear development. This is in line with observations of non-linear developmental trajectories for different aspects of human stimuli processing (voices and faces), perhaps suggesting a shift from one perceptual or cognitive strategy to another during adolescence. These results have important implications to understanding the maturation of social cognition.},

José Luis Bermúdez, extending the insights of his groundbreaking 1998 book, The Paradox of Self-Consciousness, argues that full-fledged, linguistic self-consciousness is built on a rich foundation of primitive, nonconceptual self-consciousness, and that these more primitive forms of self-consciousness persist in ways that frame self-conscious thought. They extend throughout the animal kingdom, and some are present in newborn human infants. Bermúdez makes the case that these primitive forms of self-awareness can indeed be described as forms of self-consciousness, arguing that they share certain structural and epistemological features with full-fledged, linguistic self-consciousness. He offers accounts of certain important classes of states of nonconceptual content, including the self-specifying dimension of visual perception and the content of bodily awareness, considering how they represent the self. And he explores the general role of nonconceptual self-consciousness in our cognitive and affective lives, examining in several essays the relation between nonconceptual awareness of our bodies and what has been called our “sense of ownership” for our own bodies.},

	abstract = {In this study we test the possible implications of high empathising skills on bodily self–other distinction by measuring the strength of a body ownership illusion and a related experience of illusory pain. One-hundred adult participants completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ) questionnaire. Twenty participants from the top quintile and 20 participants from the bottom quintile of the EQ distribution took part in a laboratory experiment. In the experiment, a classical Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) was induced followed by the presentation of a series of painful stimuli to the rubber hand. Participants were asked to self-rate the strength of their subjective experience of the RHI and of the illusory pain. A proprioceptive location judgment on the position of the hidden hand was also required before and after RHI induction, to record drifts towards the rubber hand. We found a significant difference between high- and low-empathy participants in RHI and pain score. The EQ was not related with the proprioceptive location judgement drift. It thus appears to be a better predictor of subjective ownership feelings and phenomenological self–other merging than of the behavioural components of bodily illusions.},

The RHI factors, proprioceptive drift, body ownership and body disownership were assessed in 48 university students. Personality and psychiatric vulnerability were measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R) and the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R). Our study pointed to the fact that the extent of behaviourally deﬁned proprioceptive drift was associated with temperament factors, especially with Novelty Seeking and Harm Avoidance. Further, the ownership was associated with Symptom Checklist factors, especially with elevated Interpersonal Sensitivity and vulnerability to Schizotypy and Paranoid Ideation and elevated disownership score was found in the case of elevated Schizotypy, including a depersonalisation feeling when the RHI was induced. The RHI may be considered as a conﬂicting situation, in which a way to cope with incongruent multimodal, visual, haptic and proprioceptive stimulation provides an opportunity to test body integration and embodiment processes in healthy participants and patients without disadvantageous outcomes. The results support and replenish the two opposite processing models of the RHI with a third, temperament-based procedural mechanism.},

	abstract = {Introduction: “Body swapping” illusions have been used to explore factors contributing to the experience of “owning” an artiﬁcial body. Preliminary research indicated that those people diagnosed with schizophrenia experience more vivid illusions of this kind than do “normal” individuals.
Objectives: Here, we explored whether participants who rated themselves “high” on the cognitive-perceptual factor of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) experienced a more compelling sense of immersion in a variation of the body swapping illusion: The Barbie Doll Illusion. We also hypothesised that these individuals would experience a change in size perception when immersed in the illusion.
Method: Forty-four participants wore a pair of Head-Mounted Display goggles connected to a video-camera, and thus a doll’s body replaced their own body in their visual ﬁeld. In two conditions, touch was either applied synchronously or asynchronously to the doll’s and each participant’s leg. After each condition, participants ﬁlled out a questionnaire relating to their experience in the illusion. When both conditions were completed, they ﬁlled out the SPQ.
Results: Our ﬁrst hypothesis was conﬁrmed, which suggested that people with higher cognitive-perceptual SPQ scores do indeed experience a more compelling Barbie Doll Illusion; however, our second hypothesis was not supported.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, that proneness to the positive and interpersonal factors of schizotypy in a normal population is suﬃcient to produce a compelling sense of swapping bodies.},

	abstract = {The perception of being located within one’s body (i.e., bodily self-location) is an essential feature of everyday self-experience. However, by manipulating exteroceptive input, healthy participants can easily be induced to perceive themselves as being spatially dislocated from their physical bodies. It has previously been suggested that interoception, i.e., the processing of inner physiological signals, contributes to the stability of body representations; however, this relationship has not previously been tested for different dimensions of interoception and bodily self-location. In the present study, using an advanced automatized setup, we systematically manipulated participants’ perspective of their own body (ﬁrst- vs third-person perspective) as well as the synchrony of visuotactile stimulation (synchronous vs asynchronous). The malleability of bodily self-location was assessed using a questionnaire targeting in-body and out-of-body experiences. Participants also performed a heartbeat discrimination task to assess their interoceptive accuracy (behavioral performance), interoceptive sensibility (conﬁdence in their interoceptive abilities), and interoceptive awareness (metacognitive representation of interoceptive signals). Bodily self-location was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by perspective, with third-person perspective being associated with stronger out-of-body experiences compared to ﬁrst-person perspective. Furthermore, there was a signiﬁcant perspective × stimulation interaction, with subsequent analyses showing that participants reported out-of-body experiences particularly under thirdperson perspective combined with synchronous visuotactile stimulation. Correlation and regression analyses revealed that meta-cognitive interoceptive awareness was speciﬁcally and negatively related to the exteroceptively mediated malleability of body experiences. These results indicate that the perception of the self being located within one’s body relies on the interaction of exteroceptive input and higher-order interoceptive abilities. This has implications for theoretical considerations about the bodily self in health as well as for the understanding of disturbed bodily self-processing in clinical contexts.},

	abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) are often co-morbid; however, the aetiology of such co-morbidity has not been well investigated. This study examined brain activation in women with AN and in healthy control (HC) women during the provocation of symmetry/ordering-related anxiety. During provocation, patients with AN showed more anxiety compared to HCs, which was correlated with the severity of symmetry/ordering symptoms. Activation in the right parietal lobe and right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) in response to provocation was reduced in the AN group compared with the HC group. The reduced right parietal activation observed in the AN group is consistent with parietal lobe involvement in visuospatial cognition and with studies of OCD reporting an association between structural abnormalities in this region and the severity of ‘ordering’ symptoms. Reduced rPFC activation in response to symmetry/ordering provocation has similarities with some, but not all, data collected from patients with AN who were exposed to images of food and bodies. Furthermore, the combination of data from the AN and HC groups showed that rPFC activation during symptom provocation was inversely correlated with the severity of symmetry/ ordering symptoms. These data suggest that individuals with AN have a diminished ability to cognitively deal with illnessassociated symptoms of provocation. Furthermore, our data also suggest that symptom provocation can progressively overload attempts by the rPFC to exert cognitive control. These findings are discussed in the context of the current neurobiological models of AN.},

	abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric condition characterized by severe weight loss and secondary problems associated with malnutrition. AN predominantly develops in adolescence in the peripubertal period. Without early effective treatment, the course is protracted with physical, psychological and social morbidity and high mortality. Despite these effects, patients are noted to value the beliefs and behaviours that contribute to their illness rather than regarding them as problematic, which interferes with screening, prevention and early intervention. Involving the family to support interventions early in the course of the illness can produce sustained changes; however, those with a severe and/or protracted illness might require inpatient nursing support and/or outpatient psychotherapy. Prevention programmes aim to moderate the overvaluation of ‘thinness’ and body dissatisfaction as one of the proximal risk factors. The low prevalence of AN limits the ability to identify risk factors and to study the timing and sex distribution of the condition. However, genetic profiles, premorbid features, and brain structures and functions of patients with AN show similarities with other psychiatric disorders and contrast with obesity and metabolic disorders. Such studies are informing approaches to address the neuroadaptation to starvation and the other various physical and psychosocial deficits associated with AN. This Primer describes the epidemiology, diagnosis, screening and prevention, aetiology, treatment and quality of life of patients with AN.},

Recently, advanced virtual reality setups were developed to induce a virtual hand illusion (VHI). Here, we present functional imaging data from a sample of 25 healthy participants using a new device to induce the VHI in the environment of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. In order to evaluate the neuronal robustness of the illusion, we varied the degree of synchrony between visual and tactile events in five steps: in two conditions, the tactile stimulation was applied prior to visual stimulation (asynchrony of 2300 ms or 2600 ms), whereas in another two conditions, the tactile stimulation was applied after visual stimulation (asynchrony of +300 ms or +600 ms). In the fifth condition, tactile and visual stimulation was applied synchronously. On a subjective level, the VHI was successfully induced by synchronous visuotactile stimulation. Asynchronies between visual and tactile input of 6300 ms did not significantly diminish the vividness of illusion, whereas asynchronies of 6600 ms did. The temporal order of visual and tactile stimulation had no effect on VHI vividness. Conjunction analyses of functional MRI data across all conditions revealed significant activation in bilateral ventral premotor cortex (PMv). Further characteristic activation patterns included bilateral activity in the motion-sensitive medial superior temporal area as well as in the bilateral Rolandic operculum, suggesting their involvement in the processing of bodily awareness through the integration of visual and tactile events. A comparison of the VHI-inducing conditions with asynchronous control conditions of 6600 ms yielded significant PMv activity only contralateral to the stimulation site. These results underline the temporal limits of the induction of limb ownership related to multisensory body-related input.},

METHODS: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we employed computational modeling to elucidate the neural correlates of feedback learning and value-based decision making in 36 female patients with AN and 36 age-matched healthy volunteers (12–24 years). Participants performed a decision task that required adaptation to changing reward contingencies. Data were analyzed within a hierarchical Gaussian ﬁlter model that captures interindividual variability in learning under uncertainty.
RESULTS: Behaviorally, patients displayed an increased learning rate speciﬁcally after punishments. At the neural level, hemodynamic correlates for the learning rate, expected value, and prediction error did not differ between the groups. However, activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex was elevated in AN following punishment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ﬁndings suggest that the neural underpinning of feedback learning is selectively altered for punishment in AN.},

	abstract = {Background—The neural mechanisms of anorexia nervosa (AN), a severe and chronic psychiatric illness, are still poorly understood. Altered body state processing, or interoception, has been documented in AN, and disturbances in aversive interoception may contribute to distorted body perception, extreme dietary restriction, and anxiety. As prior data implicate a potential mismatch between interoceptive expectation and experience in AN, we examined whether AN is associated with altered brain activation before, during, and after an unpleasant interoceptive state change.
Methods—Adult women remitted from AN (RAN; n = 17) and healthy control women (CW; n = 25) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during an inspiratory breathing load paradigm.
Results—During stimulus anticipation, the RAN group, relative to CW, showed reduced activation in right mid-insula. In contrast, during the aversive breathing load, the RAN group showed increased activation compared with CW in striatum and cingulate and prefrontal cortices. The RAN group also showed increased activation in prefrontal cortices, bilateral insula, striatum, and amygdala after stimulus offset. Time course analyses indicated that RAN responses in interoceptive processing regions during breathing load increased more steeply than those of CW. Exploratory analyses revealed that hyperactivation during and after breathing load was associated with markers of past AN severity.
Conclusions—Anticipatory deactivation with a subsequent exaggerated brain response during and after an aversive body state may contribute to difficulty predicting and adapting to internal},

	abstract = {Background. Previous studies have highlighted the role of the brain reward and cognitive control systems in the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). In an attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of these systems to the disorder, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate hemodynamic responses to reward-related stimuli presented both subliminally and supraliminally in acutely underweight AN patients and age-matched healthy controls (HC).
Methods. fMRI data were collected from a total of 35 AN patients and 35 HC, while they passively viewed subliminally and supraliminally presented streams of food, positive social, and neutral stimuli. Activation patterns of the group × stimulation condition × stimulus type interaction were interrogated to investigate potential group differences in processing different stimulus types under the two stimulation conditions. Moreover, changes in functional connectivity were investigated using generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis.
Results. AN patients showed a generally increased response to supraliminally presented stimuli in the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), but no alterations within the reward system. Increased activation during supraliminal stimulation with food stimuli was observed in the AN group in visual regions including superior occipital gyrus and the fusiform gyrus/parahippocampal gyrus. No group difference was found with respect to the subliminal stimulation condition and functional connectivity.
Conclusion. Increased IFJ activation in AN during supraliminal stimulation may indicate hyperactive cognitive control, which resonates with clinical presentation of excessive self-control in AN patients. Increased activation to food stimuli in visual regions may be interpreted in light of an attentional food bias in AN.},

	abstract = {Background: Overconcern with food and shape/weight stimuli are central to eating disorder maintenance with attentional biases seen towards these images not present in healthy controls. These stimuli trigger changes in the physiological, emotional, and neural responses in people with eating disorders, and are regularly used in research and clinical practice. However, selection of stimuli for these treatments is frequently based on self-reported emotional ratings alone, and whether self-reports reflect objective responses is unknown. Main body: This review assessed the associations across emotional self-report, physiological, and neural responses to both food and body-shape/weight stimuli in people with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). For food stimuli, either an aversive or lack of physiological effect was generated in people with AN, together with a negative emotional response on neuroimaging, and high subjective anxiety ratings. People with BN showed a positive self-rating, an aversive physiological reaction, and a motivational neural response. In BED, an aversive physiological reaction was found in contrast to motivational/appetitive neural responses, with food images rated as pleasant. The results for shape/weight stimuli showed aversive responses in some physiological modalities, which was reflected in both the emotional and neural responses, but this aversive response was not consistent across physiological studies. Conclusions: Shape/weight stimuli are more reliable for use in therapy or research than food stimuli as the impact of these images is more consistent across subjective and objective responses. Care should be taken when using food stimuli due to the disconnect reported in this review.},

	abstract = {Previous neuroimaging research of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa has mainly focused on clinical patients, indicating the crucial role of intrinsic connectivity networks involved in aberrant behavioral control (i.e., executive control network), reward reactivity (i.e., basal ganglia network), and excessive self-focused and body-focused ruminations (i.e., default mode network) in the onset and maintenance of eating disturbances. However, examinations of large-scale resting-state networks that support the role of cognitive control, reward sensitivity, and self-directed thinking in disordered eating have rarely involved non-clinical samples from the general population. This study, involving a total of 693 healthy young adults (68.69\% fe­ males; mean age, 18.37 years), investigated these issues by using pre-defined functional regions of interest from the executive control network, basal ganglia network, default mode network, and a seed-based region of interestto-region of interest approach. After statistically controlling for differences in age, sex, body mass index, and head motion, we observed significant associations of higher levels of eating disorder symptoms, especially bulimia-type eating (i.e., binge eating and a combination of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, such as purging via self-induced vomiting or laxative use, and compulsive exercise), with weaker intra-network and inter-network functional synchrony. These results remained significant after excluding underweight, overweight, and obese participants. These findings suggest that these neural circuits may play a key role in the symptoms of disordered eating in healthy adults. They further reveal that the less efficient information exchange within and between intrinsic networks associated with self-referential thinking, inhibitory control, and reward sensitivity are strongly related to eating disorder symptoms.},

Yet little is known about how regional structural changes affect intrinsic resting-state functional brain connectivity (rsFC). Using a cross-sectional, multimodal imaging approach, we investigated the association between regional cortical thickness abnormalities and rsFC in AN. Twenty-two acute AN patients and twenty-six age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan and cognitive tests. We performed group comparisons of whole-brain cortical thickness, seed-based rsFC, and networkbased statistical (NBS) analyses. AN patients showed cortical thinning in the precuneus and inferior parietal lobules, regions involved in visuospatial memory and imagery. Cortical thickness in the precuneus correlated with nutritional state and cognitive functions in AN, strengthening the evidence for a critical role of this region in the disorder. Cortical thinning was accompanied by functional connectivity reductions in major brain networks, namely default mode, sensorimotor and visual networks. Similar to the seed-based approach, the NBS analysis revealed a single network of reduced functional connectivity in patients, comprising mainly sensorimotor- occipital regions. Our ﬁndings provide evidence that structural and functional brain abnormalities in AN are conﬁned to speciﬁc regions and networks involved in visuospatial and somatosensory processing. We show that structural changes of the precuneus are linked to nutritional and functional states in AN, and future longitudinal research should assess how precuneus changes might be related to the evolution of the disorder.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To test whether brain reward learning response to taste in adolescent AN is altered and associated with treatment response, striatal-hypothalamic connectivity, and elevated harm avoidance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional multimodal brain imaging study, adolescents and young adults with AN were matched with healthy controls at a university brain imaging facility and eating disorder treatment program. During a sucrose taste classical conditioning paradigm, violations of learned associations between conditioned visual and unconditioned taste stimuli evoked the dopamine-related prediction error (PE). Dynamic effective connectivity during sweet taste receipt was studied to investigate hierarchical brain activation across the brain network that regulates eating. The study was conducted from July 2012 to May 2017, and data were analyzed from June 2017 to December 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prediction error brain reward response across the insula, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex; dynamic effective connectivity between hypothalamus and ventral striatum; and treatment weight gain, harm avoidance scores, and salivary cortisol levels and their correlations with PE brain response.
RESULTS Of 56 female participants with AN included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 16.6 (2.5) years, and the mean (SD) body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 15.9 (0.9); of 52 matched female controls, the mean (SD) age was 16.0 (2.8) years, and the mean (SD) BMI was 20.9 (2.1). Prediction error response was elevated in participants with AN in the caudate head, nucleus accumbens, and insula (multivariate analysis of covariance: Wilks λ, 0.707; P = .02; partial η2 = 0.296), which correlated negatively with sucrose taste pleasantness. Bilateral AN orbitofrontal gyrus rectus PE response was positively correlated with harm avoidance (right ρ, 0.317; 95\% CI, 0.091 to 0.539; P {\textless} .02; left ρ, 0.336; 95\% CI, 0.112 to 0.550; P {\textless} .01) but negatively correlated with treatment BMI change (right ρ, −0.282; 95\% CI, −0.534 to −0.014; P {\textless} .04; left ρ, −0.268; 95\% CI, −0.509 to −0.018; P {\textless} .045). Participants with AN showed effective connectivity from ventral striatum to hypothalamus, and connectivity strength was positively correlated with insula and orbitofrontal PE response. Right frontal cortex PE response was associated with cortisol, which correlated with body dissatisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results further support elevated PE signal in AN and suggest a link between PE and elevated harm avoidance, brain connectivity, and weight gain in AN. Prediction error may have a central role in adolescent AN in driving anxiety and ventral striatal-hypothalamus circuit-controlled food avoidance.},

Conclusions: Findings varied considerably across studies, reflecting methodological differences in study design, such as sample differences and experimental paradigms.

	abstract = {Background. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified functional connectivity patterns associated with acute undernutrition in anorexia nervosa (AN), but few have investigated recovered patients. Thus, a trait connectivity profile characteristic of the disorder remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art graph–theoretic methods in acute AN, the authors previously found abnormal global brain network architecture, possibly driven by local network alterations. To disentangle trait from starvation effects, the present study examines network organization in recovered patients.
Methods. Graph–theoretic metrics were used to assess resting-state network properties in a large sample of female patients recovered from AN (recAN, n = 55) compared with pairwise age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 55).
Results. Indicative of an altered global network structure, recAN showed increased assortativity and reduced global clustering as well as small-worldness compared with HC, while no group differences at an intermediate or local network level were evident. However, using support-vector classifier on local metrics, recAN and HC could be separated with an accuracy of 70.4\%.
Conclusions. This pattern of results suggests that long-term recovered patients have an aberrant global brain network configuration, similar to acutely underweight patients. While the finding of increased assortativity may represent a trait marker of AN, the remaining findings could be seen as a scar following prolonged undernutrition.},

Although research has investigated responses in brain regions associated with reward and habit to disorder-specific cues (e.g., food) and presumed rewards (e.g., money), little is known about the functional organization of the circuits underlying these constructs independent of stimulus. This study aimed to provide initial data on the synchrony of networks associated with reward and habit in AN by comparing resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns between AN and healthy control (HC) participants in these circuits and delineating how these patterns relate to symptoms. Using theoretically selected seeds in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), ventral caudate, and dorsal caudate, reflecting a continuum from reward- to habit- oriented regions, RSFC patterns were compared between AN restricting subtype (n = 19) and HC (n = 19) participants (cluster threshold: p {\textless} .01). Exploratory correlations between RSFC z-scores and Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) scores, BMI, and illness duration were conducted. The AN group demonstrated lower RSFC between the NAcc and superior frontal gyrus, between the ventral caudate and frontal and posterior regions, and between the dorsal caudate and frontal, temporal, and posterior regions. In the AN group, lower NAcc- superior frontal gyrus RSFC correlated with greater EDE Global scores (r = −.58, CI: −.83, −.13). These resting-state synchrony disruptions of the ventral and dorsal frontostriatal circuits, considered in context of the broader literature, support the utility of further investigating possible reward and habit disturbances supporting symptoms in AN.},

Extant ﬁndings suggest that those with AN may rely on heightened recruitment of prefrontal regions during initial formation of food—cue learning and diﬃculty extinguishing these relationships may result from elevated insula activity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing behavioral and neuronal responses to food—cue acquisition and reversal between adolescents with AN and healthy controls. Compared to controls, acquisition of a food—cue association and its reversal were associated with elevated prefrontal activation in adolescents with AN. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups in insula activation and no behavioral diﬀerences in the ability to acquire or reverse the food—cue association. The results suggest that adolescents with AN recruit prefrontal regulatory networks to acquire and alter expectancies to food. This pattern of top-down prefrontal control suggests that clinical interventions that target changes in food—cue relationships and rely on cognitive control may be less eﬀective. Interventions that alter behavior without reliance on this top-down control may have advantages with this population.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Functional networks develop throughout adolescence when anorexia nervosa (AN) normally debuts. In AN, cerebral structural alterations are found in most brain regions and may be related to the observed functional brain changes. Few studies have investigated the functional networks of the brain in adolescent AN patients.. The aim of this explorative study was to investigate multiple functional networks in adolescent AN patients compared to healthy age-matched controls (HC) and the relationship with age, eating disorder symptoms and structural alterations.
Methods: Included were 29 female inpatients with restrictive AN, and 27 HC. All participants were between the ages of 12 to 18 years. Independent component analysis (ICA) identified 21 functional networks that were analyzed with multivariate and univariate analyses of components and group affiliation (AN vs HC). Age, age × group interaction and AN symptoms were included as covariates. Follow-up correlational analyses of selected components and structural measures (cortical thickness and subcortical volume) were carried out.
Results: Decreased functional connectivity (FC) in AN patients was found in one cortical network, involving mainly the precuneus, and identified as a default mode network (DMN). Cortical thickness in the precuneus was significantly correlated with functional connectivity in this network. Significant group differences were also found in two subcortical networks involving mainly the hippocampus and the amygdala respectively, and a significant interaction effect of age and group was found in both these networks. There were no significant associations between FC and the clinical measures used in the study.
Conclusion: The findings from the present study may imply that functional alterations are related to structural alterations in selected regions and that the restricted food intake in AN patients disrupt normal age-related development of functional networks involving the amygdala and hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) share distorted perceptions of appearance with extreme negative emotion, yet the neural phenotypes of emotion processing remain underexplored in them, and they have never been directly compared. We sought to determine if shared and disorder-speciﬁc fronto-limbic connectivity patterns characterize these disorders. FMRI data was obtained from three unmedicated groups: BDD (n = 32), weight-restored AN (n = 25), and healthy controls (HC; n = 37), while they viewed fearful faces and rated their own degree of fearfulness in response. We performed dynamic effective connectivity modeling with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and amygdala as regions-of-interest (ROI), and assessed associations between connectivity and clinical variables. HCs exhibited signiﬁcant within-group bidirectional mPFC-amygdala connectivity, which increased across the blocks, whereas BDD participants exhibited only signiﬁcant mPFC-to-amygdala connectivity (P {\textless} 0.05, family-wise error corrected). In contrast, participants with AN lacked signiﬁcant prefrontal-amygdala connectivity in either direction. AN showed signiﬁcantly weaker mPFC-to-amygdala connectivity compared to HCs (P = 0.0015) and BDD (P = 0.0050). The mPFC-to-amygdala connectivity was associated with greater subjective fear ratings (R2 = 0.11, P = 0.0016), eating disorder symptoms (R2 = 0.33, P = 0.0029), and anxiety (R2 = 0.29, P = 0.0055) intensity scores. Our ﬁndings, which suggest a complex nosological relationship, have implications for understanding emotion regulation circuitry in these related psychiatric disorders, and may have relevance for current and novel therapeutic approaches.},

Diﬀerent symptom categories of AN have been correlated with distinct neurobiological patterns in previous studies. The aim of this literature review is to provide a narrative overview of the investigations into neural correlates of disorder-speciﬁc stimuli in patients with AN. Although ﬁndings vary across studies, a summary of neuroimaging results according to stimulus category allows us to account for methodological diﬀerences in experimental paradigms. Based on the available evidence, the following conclusions can be made: (a) the neural processing of visual food cues is characterized by increased top-down control, which enables restrictive eating, (b) increased emotional and reward processing during gustatory stimulation triggers disorder-speciﬁc thought patterns, (c) hunger ceases to motivate food foraging but instead reinforces disorder-related behaviors, (d) body image processing is related to increased emotional and hedonic reactions, (e) emotional stimuli provoke increased saliency associated with decreased top-down control and (f) neural hypersensitivity during interoceptive processing reinforces avoidance behavior. Taken together, studies that investigated symptom-speciﬁc neural processing have contributed to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of AN.},

To date, very few studies have explored how these behavioural observations are paralleled by functional brain development. Furthermore, currently no studies have explored the development of emotion modulation in these areas. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the brain activity of 25 children (age 6–11), 18 adolescents (age 12–17) and 26 adults while they passively viewed short videos of angry, happy or neutral body movements. We observed that when viewing dynamic bodies generally, adults showed higher activity than children bilaterally in the body-selective areas; namely the extra-striate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), as well as the amygdala (AMY). Adults also showed higher activity than adolescents, but only in the right hemisphere. Crucially, however, we found that there were no age diﬀerences in the emotion modulation of activity in these areas. These results indicate, for the ﬁrst time, that despite activity selective to body perception increasing across childhood and adolescence, emotion modulation of these areas in adult-like from 7 years of age.},

Although proprioceptive functioning improves during childhood and adolescence, we still have few clues about how the proprioceptive brain network develops. Here, we investigated developmental changes in the functional organization of this network in early adolescents (n = 18, 12 ± 1 years), late adolescents (n = 18, 15 ± 1), and young adults (n = 18, 32 ± 4), by examining task-evoked univariate activity and patterns of functional connectivity (FC) associated with seeds placed in cortical (supramarginal gyrus) and subcortical (dorsal rostral putamen) regions. We found that although the network is already well established in early adolescence both in terms of topology and functioning principles (e.g., long-distance communication and economy in wiring cost), it is still undergoing reﬁnement during adolescence, including a shift from diffuse to focal FC and a decreased FC strength. This developmental effect was particularly pronounced for frontostriatal connections. Furthermore, changes in FC features continued beyond adolescence, although to a much lower extent. Altogether, these ﬁndings point to a protracted developmental time course for the proprioceptive network, which breaks with the relatively early functional maturation often associated with sensorimotor networks.},

Examples for the use of internal models include anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), where the individual anticipates and cancels out the destabilizing effect of movement on body posture. Yet little is known about the functional changes in the brain supporting the development of APAs. Here, we addressed this issue by relating individual differences in APAs as assessed during bimanual load lifting to interindividual variation in brain network interactions at rest. We showed that the strength of the connectivity between three main canonical brain networks, namely the cingulo-opercular, the fronto-parietal and the somatosensory-motor networks, is an index of the ability to implement APAs from late childhood (9- to 11-year-old children). We also found an effect of age on the relationship between APAs and coupling strength between these networks, consistent with the notion that APAs are near but not yet fully mature in children. We discuss the implications of these ﬁndings for our understanding of learning disorders with impairment in predictive motor control.},

	abstract = {For most people, adolescence is synonymous with emotional turmoil and it has been shown that early difﬁculties with emotion regulation can lead to persistent problems for some people. This suggests that intervention during development might reduce long-term negative consequences for those individuals. Recent research has highlighted the suitability of real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback (NF) in training emotion regulation (ER) networks in adults. However, its usefulness in directly inﬂuencing plasticity in the maturing ER networks remains unclear. Here, we used NF to teach a group of 17 7–16 year-olds to up-regulate the bilateral insula, a key ER region. We found that all participants learned to increase activation during the up-regulation trials in comparison to the down-regulation trials. Importantly, a subsequent Granger causality analysis of Granger information ﬂow within the wider ER network found that during up-regulation trials, bottom-up driven Granger information ﬂow increased from the amygdala to the bilateral insula and from the left insula to the mid-cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area and the inferior parietal lobe. This was reversed during the down-regulation trials, where we observed an increase in top-down driven Granger information ﬂow to the bilateral insula from mid-cingulate cortex, pre-central gyrus and inferior parietal lobule. This suggests that: 1) NF training had a differential effect on up-regulation vs down-regulation network connections, and that 2) our training was not only superﬁcially concentrated on surface effects but also relevant with regards to the underlying neurocognitive bases. Together these ﬁndings highlight the feasibility of using NF in children and adolescents and its possible use for shaping key social cognitive networks during development.},

Despite the overlap of functionally defined FFA and FBA (54\%–75\% overlap), we found that these regions developed along different trajectories. With age (7–32 years old), the FFA gradually increased in size and selectivity, and was significantly larger and more face-selective in adults than children. By contrast, the size and selectivity of the FBA did not correlate with age, and were equivalent in children and adults. Whereas in adults the FFA and FBA were comparable in size, in children the FBA was on average 70\% larger than the FFA. These findings suggest that, in children, the fusiform gyrus is predominantly selective for bodies, with commensurate face-selective responses apparent later in development. Moreover, differences in the development of the FFA and FBA indicate that overlapping functional brain areas, supported by the same anatomical structure, can develop along different trajectories.},

	abstract = {It is well known that adult human extrastriate visual cortex contains areas that respond in a selective fashion to speciﬁc categories of visual stimuli. Three regions have been identiﬁed with particular regularity: the fusiform face area (FFA), which responds to faces more than to other objects; the parahippocampal place area (PPA), which responds selectively to images of houses, places, and visual scenes; and the extrastriate body area (EBA), which responds speciﬁcally to images of bodies and body parts. While the presence of these regions in the mature human brain is well-established, the degree to which children possess these areas and the degree of functional specialization of these areas in children of various ages has thus far remained unclear. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the development of the FFA, EBA, and PPA in healthy, typically developing 7- to 11-year-old children and adults. Our results revealed a right FFA and a bilateral EBA and PPA in the children that were localized in a way consistent with these same regions in adults. In addition, the response proﬁles of these regions were very similar in adults and children with comparable levels of functional speciﬁcity at all of the ages tested. We discuss the implications of this research for understanding abnormal regional specialization for social and nonsocial object categories in individuals with autism spectrum disorders.},

Unlike externalperception, the inner sensory flow never stops and cannot bevoluntarily controlled. Thus, an important amount of information isconstantly available whether we want it or not, whether we payattention to it or not. In that respect, our body qualifies as theobject that we know best. Yet, despite numerous sources ofinformation, the phenomenology of bodily awareness is limited. Inpainful and learning situations, our body appears at the core of ourinterest, but when we walk in the street, we are rarely aware of theprecise position of our legs and of the contact of the floor on ourfeet. Schwitzgebel (2007), for instance, asked how frequentlyparticipants wearing a device beeping at random intervals had tactileexperiences in their left foot just before the beeping sound. He founda high variability in the answers, but one participant reportedtactile sensations only 16\% of the time. Our conscious field isprimarily occupied by our environment, instead of the bodily mediumthat allows us to perceive it and to move through it. Hence, the mostpermanent and preponderant object in life may also be the most elusiveone (Leder 1990; Merleau-Ponty 1945; O’Shaughnessy 1980)., One may then question whether we are completely unaware of it. Exceptin rare illusory or pathological cases, we never feel fullydisembodied. James (1890: 242), for instance, claims that we areconstantly conscious of the presence of our body, although at themargin of the stream of our consciousness: , Similarly, Gurwitsch (1985: 60) asserts: , But what is the content of this marginal body consciousness? It seemsto be reducible to the “feeling of the same old body alwaysthere” or to a mere “feeling of warmth and intimacy”(James 1890: 242). But can we go beyond this rough and metaphoricaldescription?, Although for a long time the exclusive province of phenomenology(Husserl 1913; Gurwitsch 1985; Merleau-Ponty 1945; Henri 1965; dePreester 2007; Gallagher 2005; Legrand 2006; Mishara 2004; Carman1999), bodily awareness has attracted more and more attention fromphilosophers from all traditions, leading among others to severalmonographs and multidisciplinary volumes (for instance, seeBermúdez et al. (eds.) 1995; Knoblich et al. (eds.) 2005;Fulkerson 2014; Vignemont \& Alsmith (eds.) 2017; Bermúdez2018; Vignemont 2018; Guillot\& García-Carpintero (eds.) forthcoming; Tsakiris \& dePreester (eds.) 2018; Vignemont, Serino et al. (eds.) forthcoming). Thisruns in parallel with a boom of research in cognitive neuroscience. Inparticular, bodily illusions have raised a wide range of philosophicalquestions about the underlying mechanisms of bodily self-awareness,questions that are still open nowadays. For instance, it has beenfound that if one looks at a rubber hand, while one’s own handis hidden, and both the rubber and the real hands are synchronouslystroked, one can report feeling as if the rubber hand were one’shand (Botvinick \& Cohen 1998). The rubber hand illusion has beentaken as the key for understanding bodily self-awareness. Yet, aftermore than twenty years of research, what have we really learnt aboutthe body and the self?, The entry first describes the special way one has of knowingone’s body from the inside. After comparing it with visualawareness and assessing its epistemological significance, it will askwhether it should be understood as a form of perception. The entrywill then discuss the involvement of mental representations for bodilyawareness, specifically exploring its relation with action and thenotion of body schema. In the last section, the entry will reviewseveral accounts of the sense of bodily ownership.},

This chapter reviews the perceptual, motoric and high-level representational symptoms manifested in neglect patients and attempt to classify them according to the body image/schema framework. One puzzling aspect of the wide spectrum of body neglect symptoms is that physiological bottom-up maneuvers, such as prism adaptation, which act at the level of body schema, do also efficiently improve body image manifestations of neglect. This relationship allows us to elaborate on the dialectical relationships between body image and body schema. Thus, understanding body neglect in terms of diagnosis, evaluation, physiopathology and therapeutics through the dynamical interactions between body schema and body neglect, provide perspectives to manage other lateralized body troubles, neglect-like manifestations of bodily attention or distorted representations.},

	abstract = {Objective: Although body-image disturbance is among the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, the nature and extent of this disturbance have not been precisely identiﬁed. This is the purpose of this ﬁrst meta-analysis of extant research on body image and eating disorders. Method: Using contemporary techniques, the meta-analysis systematically examined 66 studies (from 1974 to 1993) of perceptual and attitudinal parameters of body image among anorexics and bulimics relative to control groups. Results: Attitudinal body dissatisfaction, both questionnaire and self-ideal discrepancy measures, produced substantially larger effect sizes than did perceptual size-estimation inaccuracy. Body dissatisfaction measures, whether global or weight/shape related, differentiated bulimic and anorexic groups (with bulimics having more dissatisfaction), whereas perceptual distortion indices did not. Somewhat larger effects occurred with whole-body than with body-part size-estimation assessments. Size distortion among patients with eating disorders appears unlikely to reﬂect a more generalized sensory/perceptual deﬁcit.

	abstract = {Previous studies investigated bodily self-consciousness (BSC) by experimentally exposing subjects to multisensory conflicts (i.e., visuo-tactile, audio-tactile, visuocardiac) in virtual reality (VR) that involve the participant's torso in a paradigm known as the full-body illusion (FBI). Using a modified FBI paradigm, we found that synchrony of visuo-respiratory stimulation (i.e., a flashing outline surrounding an avatar in VR; the flash intensity depending on breathing), is also able to modulate BSC by increasing self-location and breathing agency toward the virtual body. Our aim was to investigate such visuo-respiratory effects and determine whether respiratory motor commands contributes to BSC, using non-invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e., machine-delivered breathing). Seventeen healthy participants took part in a visuo-respiratory FBI paradigm and performed the FBI during two breathing conditions: (a) “active breathing” (i.e., participants actively initiate machine-delivered breaths) and (b) “passive breathing” (i.e., breaths’ timing was determined by the machine). Respiration rate, tidal volume, and their variability were recorded. In line with previous results, participants experienced subjective changes in self-location, breathing agency, and self-identification toward the avatar's body, when presented with synchronous visuo-respiratory stimulation. Moreover, drift in self-location was reduced and tidal volume variability were increased by asynchronous visuorespiratory stimulations. Such effects were not modulated by breathing control manipulations. Our results extend previous FBI findings showing that visuo-respiratory stimulation affects BSC, independently from breathing motor command initiation. Also, variability of respiratory parameters was influenced by visuo-respiratory feedback and might reduce breathing discomfort. Further exploration of such findings might inform the development of respiratory therapeutic tools using VR in patients.},

In 2 experiments, using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated (1) the neural sources of HEPs, (2) the underlying mechanisms for HEP generation, and (3) the functional role of HEPs in bodily self-consciousness. In Experiment-1, we found that shortly after the heartbeat onset, phase distributions across single trials were signiﬁcantly concentrated in 10\% of the recording sites, mainly in the insula and the operculum, but also in other regions including the amygdala and fronto-temporal cortex. Such phase concentration was not accompanied by increased spectral power, and did not correlate with spectral power changes, suggesting that a phase resetting, rather than an additive “evoked potential” mechanism, underlies HEP generation. In Experiment-2, we further aimed to anatomically reﬁne previous scalp EEG data that linked HEPs with bodily self-consciousness. We found that HEP modulations in the insula reﬂected an experimentally induced altered sense of self-identiﬁcation. Collectively, these results provide novel and solid electrophysiological evidence on the neural sources and underlying mechanisms of HEPs, and their functional role in self-consciousness.},

	abstract = {Background: Early traumatic experiences are thought to be causal factors in the development of traumarelated dissociative experiences, including depersonalization and derealization. The rubber hand illusion (RHI), a well-known paradigm that measures multi-sensorial integration of a rubber hand into one’s own body representation, has been used to investigate alterations in the experience of body ownership and of body representation. Critically, however, it has never been studied in individuals with trauma-related disorders.
Objective: To investigate body representation distortions occurring in trauma-related disorders in response to the RHI.
Method: The RHI was administered to three individuals with the dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and subjective, behavioral, cardiovascular and skin conductance responses were recorded.
Results: Participants’ subjective experiences of the RHI were differentiated and complex. The illusion was induced following both synchronous and asynchronous brushing and variably evoked subjective distress, depersonalization and derealization experiences, tonic immobility, increased physiological arousal and flashbacks.
Conclusions: The present findings point towards the RHI as a strong provocation stimulus that elicits individual patterns of symptom presentation, including experiences of distress and dissociation, in individuals with trauma-related disorders, including the dissociative subtype of PTSD.},

	abstract = {Background: A weakened sense of self may contribute to psychotic experiences. Body ownership, one component of selfawareness, can be studied with the rubber hand illusion (RHI). Watching a rubber hand being stroked while one’s unseen hand is stroked synchronously can lead to a sense of ownership over the rubber hand, a shift in perceived position of the real hand, and a limb-specific drop in stimulated hand temperature. We aimed to assess the RHI in schizophrenia using quantifiable measures: proprioceptive drift and stimulation-dependent changes in hand temperature.
Methods: The RHI was elicited in 24 schizophrenia patients and 21 matched controls by placing their unseen hand adjacent to a visible rubber hand and brushing real and rubber hands synchronously or asynchronously. Perceived finger location was measured before and after stimulation. Hand temperature was taken before and during stimulation. Subjective strength of the illusion was assessed by a questionnaire.
Results: Across groups, the RHI was stronger during synchronous stimulation, indicated by self-report and proprioceptive drift. Patients reported a stronger RHI than controls. Self-reported strength of RHI was associated with schizotypy in controls Proprioceptive drift was larger in patients, but only following synchronous stimulation. Further, we observed stimulationdependent changes in skin temperature. During right hand stimulation, temperature dropped in the stimulated hand and rose in the unstimulated hand. Interestingly, induction of RHI led to an out-of-body experience in one patient, linking body disownership and psychotic experiences.
Conclusions: The RHI is quantitatively and qualitatively stronger in schizophrenia. These findings suggest that patients have a more flexible body representation and weakened sense of self, and potentially indicate abnormalities in temporo-parietal networks implicated in body ownership. Further, results suggest that these body ownership disturbances might be at the heart of a subset of the pathognomonic delusions of passivity.},

	abstract = {The rubber hand illusion paradigm allows investigating human body ownership by inducing an illusion of owning a life-sized fake hand. Despite the wide consensus on the fact that integration of multisensory signals is the main interpretative framework of the rubber hand illusion, increasing amount of data show that additional factors might contribute to the emergence of the illusion and, in turn, explain the strong inter-individual differences of the illusory patterns. Here, we explored whether and how personality features contribute to the emergence of the illusion by administering to healthy participants the rubber hand illusion paradigm along with two wellknown personality tests, i.e., the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and the Rorschach test. Results showed that two Rorschach domains (i.e., “Perception and Thinking Problems” and “Self and Other Representation”) were positively correlated with the illusory mislocalization of the own left hand toward the fake hand. Further analyses suggested that while the tendency to perceive unconventionally is related to mislocalizing the own hand toward the fake hand, the association of the RHI index and other personality features measured by the Rorschach remain uncertain. However, our ﬁndings in general suggest that personality features might have a role in the emergence of the rubber hand illusion. This, in turn, could explain the high inter-individual variability of the illusory effects.},

	abstract = {While the Sense of Agency (SoA) has so far been predominantly characterised in VR as a component of the Sense of Embodiment, other communities (e.g., in psychology or neurosciences) have investigated the SoA from a different perspective proposing complementary theories. Yet, despite the acknowledged potential beneﬁts of catching up with these theories a gap remains. This paper ﬁrst aims to contribute to ﬁll this gap by introducing a theory according to which the SoA can be divided into two components, the feeling and the judgment of agency, and relies on three principles, namely the principles of priority, exclusivity and consistency. We argue that this theory could provide insights on the factors inﬂuencing the SoA in VR systems. Second, we propose novel approaches to manipulate the SoA in controlled VR experiments (based on these three principles) as well as to measure the SoA, and more speciﬁcally its two components based on neurophysiological markers, using ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG). We claim that these approaches would enable us to deepen our understanding of the SoA in VR contexts. Finally, we validate these approaches in an experiment. Our results (N=24) suggest that our approach was successful in manipulating the SoA as the modulation of each of the three principles induced signiﬁcant decreases of the SoA (measured using questionnaires). In addition, we recorded participants’ EEG signals during the VR experiment, and neurophysiological markers of the SoA, potentially reﬂecting the feeling and judgment of agency speciﬁcally, were revealed. Our results also suggest that users’ proﬁle, more precisely their Locus of Control (LoC), inﬂuences their level of immersion and SoA.},

	abstract = {The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an enigmatic illusion that creates a feeling of owning an artificial limb. Enthusiasts of this paradigm assert that it operationalizes bodily self-awareness, but there are reasons to doubt such a clear link. Because little is known about other functional contributions to the RHI, including effects of contextdependent visual processing and cognitive control or the ability to resolve intermodal conflict, we carried out two complementary experiments. In the first, we examined the relationships between the RHI and (1) body awareness, as assessed by the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ); (2) context-dependent visual processing, as assessed by the rodand-frame test (RFT); and (3) conflict resolution, as assessed by the Stroop test. We found a significant positive correlation between the RHI-associated proprioceptive drift and context-dependent visual processing on the RFT, but not between the RHI and body awareness on the BPQ. In the second experiment, we examined the RHI in advanced yoga practitioners with an embodied lifestyle and a heightened sense of their own body in space. They succumbed to the illusion just as much as did yoga-naïve control participants, despite significantly greater body awareness on the BPQ. These findings suggest that susceptibility to the RHI and awareness of one’s own body are at least partially independent processes.},

	abstract = {We review a recent shift in conceptions of interoception and its relationship to hierarchical inference in the brain. The notion of interoceptive inference means that bodily states are regulated by autonomic reflexes that are enslaved by descending predictions from deep generative models of our internal and external milieu. This re-conceptualization illuminates several issues in cognitive and clinical neuroscience with implications for experiences of selfhood and emotion. We first contextualize interoception in terms of active (Bayesian) inference in the brain, highlighting its enactivist (embodied) aspects. We then consider the key role of uncertainty or precision and how this might translate into neuromodulation. We next examine the implications for understanding the functional anatomy of the emotional brain, surveying recent observations on agranular cortex. Finally, we turn to theoretical issues, namely, the role of interoception in shaping a sense of embodied self and feelings. We will draw links between physiological homoeostasis and allostasis, early cybernetic ideas of predictive control and hierarchical generative models in predictive processing. The explanatory scope of interoceptive inference ranges from explanations for autism and depression, through to consciousness. We offer a brief survey of these exciting developments.

How does the brain tag the protagonist of an imagined scene as being oneself or someone else? Crucially, during imagination, neither external stimuli nor motor feedback are available to disentangle imagining oneself from imagining someone else. Here, we test the hypothesis that an internal mechanism based on the neural monitoring of heartbeats could distinguish between self and other. 23 participants imagined themselves (from a ﬁrst-person perspective) or a friend (from a third-person perspective) in various scenarios, while their brain activity was recorded with magnetoencephalography and their cardiac activity was simultaneously monitored. We measured heartbeat-evoked responses, i.e. transients of neural activity occurring in response to each heartbeat, during imagination. The amplitude of heartbeat-evoked responses differed between imagining oneself and imagining a friend, in the precuneus and posterior cingulate regions bilaterally. Effect size was modulated by the daydreaming frequency scores of participants but not by their interoceptive abilities. These results could not be accounted for by other characteristics of imagination (e.g., the ability to adopt the perspective, valence or arousal), nor by cardiac parameters (e.g., heart rate) or arousal levels (e.g. arousal ratings, pupil diameter). Heartbeat-evoked responses thus appear as a neural marker distinguishing self from other during imagination.},

	abstract = {The effect of multisensory-induced changes on body-ownership and self-awareness using bodily illusions has been well established. More recently, experimental manipulation of bodily illusions have been combined with social cognition tasks to investigate whether changes in body-ownership can in turn change the way we perceive others. For example, experiencing ownership over a dark-skin rubber hand reduces implicit bias against darkskin groups. Several studies have also shown that processing of skin color and facial features play an important role in judgements of racial typicality and racial categorization independently and in an additive manner. The present study aimed at examining whether using multisensory stimulation to induce feelings of body-ownership over a dark-skin rubber hand would lead to an increase in positive attitudes toward black faces. We here show, that the induced ownership of a body-part of a different skin color affected the participants’ implicit attitudes when processing facial features, in addition to the processing of skin color shown previously. Furthermore, when the levels of pre-existing attitudes toward black people were taken into account, the effect of the rubber hand illusion on the poststimulation implicit attitudes was only signiﬁcant for those participants who had a negative initial attitude toward black people, with no signiﬁcant effects found for those who had positive initial attitudes toward black people. Taken together, our ﬁndings corroborate the hypothesis that the representation of the self and its relation to others, as given to us by body-related multisensory processing, is critical in maintaining but also in changing social attitudes.},

	abstract = {We come to understand other people’s physical and mental states by re-mapping their bodily states onto our sensorimotor system. This process, also called somatosensory resonance, is an essential ability for social cognition and is stronger when observing ingroup than outgroup members. Here we investigated, ﬁrst, whether implicit racial bias constrains somatosensory resonance, and second, whether increasing the ingroup/outgroup perceived physical similarity results in an increase in the somatosensory resonance for outgroup members. We used the Visual Remapping of Touch effect as an index of individuals’ ability in resonating with the others, and the Implicit Association Test to measure racial bias. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to detect near-threshold tactile stimuli delivered to their own face while viewing either an ingroup or an outgroup face receiving a similar stimulation. Our results showed that individuals’ tactile accuracy when viewing an outgroup face being touched was negatively correlated to their implicit racial bias. In Experiment 2, participants received the interpersonal multisensory stimulation (IMS) while observing an outgroup member. IMS has been found to increase the perceived physical similarity between the observer’s and the observed body. We tested whether such increase in ingroup/outgroup perceived physical similarity increased the remapping ability for outgroup members. We found that after sharing IMS experience with an outgroup member, tactile accuracy when viewing touch on outgroup faces increased. Interestingly, participants with stronger implicit bias against the outgroup showed larger positive change in the remapping. We conclude that shared multisensory experiences might represent one key way to improve our ability to resonate with others by overcoming the boundaries between ingroup and outgroup categories.},

Using heartbeat perception, we measured the effect on interoceptive awareness of two experimental manipulations, designed to heighten attention to bodily and narrative aspects of the self. Participants gazed at a photograph of their own face or at self-relevant words. In both experimental conditions interoceptive awareness was signiﬁcantly increased, compared to baseline. Results show that attention to narrative aspects of self, previously regarded as relying on higher-order processes, has an effect similar to self-face stimuli in improving interoceptive awareness.

Participants in the present study were 40 women with AN and 40 healthy women with no history of an eating disorder. Body-related negative interpretation bias (i.e., a tendency to interpret ambiguous information about the own body in a negative way) was measured by a Scrambled Sentences Task. Patients with AN showed a stronger body-related negative interpretation bias than healthy controls. Within both groups, negative interpretation bias correlated strongly and positively with AN symptom severity and these eﬀects were not moderated by levels of depressive symptoms. The ﬁndings support the idea that biased interpretation of body-related information is associated with the speciﬁc psychopathology of AN. Targeted, computerised interventions (e.g. interpretation bias modiﬁcation) may help to alter these dysfunctional cognitive schemas that lie at the heart of AN.},

We undertook this study to shed new light on the social-cognitive profile of patients with AN, analysing Theory of Mind and emotional functioning. Starting from previous evidence on the role of the amygdala in the neurobiology of AN and in the social cognition, we hypothesise preserved Theory of Mind and impaired emotional functioning in patients with AN.
Methodology: Thirty women diagnosed with AN and thirty-two women matched for education and age were involved in the study. Theory of Mind and emotional functioning were assessed with a set of validated experimental tasks. A measure of perceived social support was also used to test the correlations between this dimension and the social-cognitive profile of AN patients. Principal Findings: The performance of patients with AN is significantly worse than that of healthy controls on tasks assessing emotional functioning, whereas patients’ performance is comparable to that of healthy controls on the Theory of Mind task. Correlation analyses showed no relationship between scores on any of the social-cognition tasks and either age of onset or duration of illness. A correlation between social support and emotional functioning was found. This latter result seems to suggest a potential role of social support in the treatment and recovery of AN.
Conclusions: The pattern of results followed the experimental hypothesis. They may be useful to help us better understand the social-cognitive profile of patients with AN and to contribute to the development of effective interventions based on the ways in which patients with AN actually perceive their social environment.},

We examined the rubber hand illusion in children with and without ASD. Children with ASD were initially less susceptible to the illusion than the comparison group, yet showed the effects of the illusion after 6 minutes. Delayed susceptibility to the illusion may result from atypical multisensory temporal integration and/or an unusually strong reliance on proprioception. Children with ASD who displayed less empathy were significantly less likely to experience the illusion than those with more intact ability to express empathy.

	abstract = {Introduction: Many researchers took advantage of the well-­established rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm to explore the link between the sense of body ownership and the different brain structures and networks. Here, we aimed to review the studies that have investigated this phenomenon by means of neurophysiological techniques.
Methods: The MEDLINE, accessed by Pubmed and EMBASE electronic databases, was searched using the medical subject headings: “Rubber hand illusion” AND “Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)” OR “Evoked potentials (EP)” OR “Event related potentials (ERP)” OR “Electroencephalography (EEG)”.
Results: Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies revealed a significant excitability drop in primary motor cortex hand circuits accompanying the disembodiment of the real hand during the RHI experience and that the perceived ownership over the rubber hand is associated with normal parietal–­motor communication. Moreover, TMS provided causal evidence that the extrastriate body area is involved in the RHI and subsequently in body representation, while neuromodulation of ventral premotor area and the inferior parietal lobe did not result in an enhancement of embodiment. EP and ERP studies suggest that pre-­existing body representations may affect larger stages of tactile processing and support predictive coding models of the functional architecture of multisensory integration in bodily perceptual experience. High-­frequency oscillations on EEG play a role in the integrative processing of stimuli across modalities, and EEG activity in γ band activity in the parietal area reflects the visuotactile integration process. EEG studies also revealed that RHI is associated with the neural circuits underlying motor control and that premotor areas play a crucial role in mediating illusory body ownership.
Conclusion: Neurophysiological studies shed new light on our understanding of the different aspects that contribute to the formation of a coherent self-­awareness in humans.},

	abstract = {Objects which a human agent controls by efferent activities (such as real or virtual tools) can be perceived by the agent as belonging to his or her body. This suggests that what an agent counts as “body” is plastic, depending on what she or he controls. Yet there are possible limitations for such momentary plasticity. One of these limitations is that sensations stemming from the body (e.g., proprioception) and sensations stemming from objects outside the body (e.g., vision) are not integrated if they do not sufﬁciently “match”. What “matches” and what does not is conceivably determined by long–term experience with the perceptual changes that body movements typically produce. Children have accumulated less sensorimotor experience than adults have. Consequently, they express higher ﬂexibility to integrate body-internal and body-external signals, independent of their “match” as suggested by rubber hand illusion studies. However, children’s motor performance in tool use is more affected by mismatching body-internal and body-external action effects than that of adults, possibly because of less developed means to overcome such mismatches. We review research on perception-action interactions, multisensory integration, and developmental psychology to build bridges between these research ﬁelds. By doing so, we account for the ﬂexibility of the sense of body ownership for actively controlled events and its development through ontogeny. This gives us the opportunity to validate the suggested mechanisms for generating ownership by investigating their effects in still developing and incomplete stages in children. We suggest testable predictions for future studies investigating both body ownership and motor skills throughout the lifespan.},

In the present study, we investigated whether this was true for stereotypes related to body size: body satisfaction and eating control behavior. Healthy participants underwent the full-body illusion paradigm with an avatar having either a larger or a slimmer body than their own, and were assessed for implicit attitudes towards body image and food calorie content at baseline and after each full-body illusion session. Results showed that the illusion emerged regardless of the avatar's body size, whereas the perceived dimension of the own body size changed according to the avatar's body size (i.e., participants felt to be slimmer after embodying their slim avatar and larger after embodying their large avatar). Crucially, we found that implicit attitudes towards food, but not those towards one's own body, were modulated by the size of the virtual body. Compared to baseline, ownership of a slimmer avatar increased the avoidance of high-calorie food, whereas ownership of a larger avatar did not induce changes. Our ﬁndings suggest that the illusory feeling of being slimmer drives also the food-related stereotypes associated with that body size, increasing the regulation of eating behaviors.},

	abstract = {Body ownership refers to the distinct sensation that our observed body belongs to us, which is believed to stem from multisensory integration. This is commonly shown through the rubber hand illusion (RHI), which induces a sense of ownership over a false limb. Whilst the RHI may interfere with objectdirected action and alter motor cortical activity, it is not yet clear whether a sense of ownership over an artificial hand has functional consequences for movement production per se. As such, we performed two motion-tracking experiments (n = 117) to examine the effects of the RHI on the reaction time, acceleration, and velocity of rapid index finger abduction. We observed little convincing evidence that the induction of the RHI altered these kinematic variables. Moreover, the subjective sensations of rubber hand ownership, referral of touch, and agency did not convincingly correlate with kinematic variables, and nor did proprioceptive drift, suggesting that changes in body representation elicited by the RHI may not influence basic movement. Whilst experiment 1 suggested that individuals reporting a greater sensation of the real hand disappearing performed movements with smaller acceleration and velocity following illusion induction, we did not replicate this effect in a second experiment, suggesting that these effects may be small or not particularly robust. Overall, these results indicate that manipulating the conscious experience of body ownership has little impact on basic motor control, at least in the RHI with healthy participants.},

Earlier studies have focused on the factors that determine the elicitation of this illusion, the relative contribution of vision, touch and other sensory modalities involved and the best ways to quantify this perceptual phenomenon. Questionnaires serve to assess the subjective feeling of ownership, whereas proprioceptive drift is a measure of the recalibration of hand position sense towards the rubber hand when the illusion is induced. Proprioceptive drift has been widely used and thought of as an objective measure of the illusion, although the relationship between this measure and the subjective illusion is not fully understood. Here, we examined how long the illusion is maintained after the synchronous visuotactile stimulation stops with the specific aim of clarifying the temporal relationship in the reduction of both subjective ownership and proprioceptive drift. Our results show that both the feeling of ownership and proprioceptive drift are sustained for tens of seconds after visuotactile stroking has ceased. Furthermore, our results indicate that the reduction of proprioceptive drift and the feeling of ownership follow similar time courses in their reduction, suggesting that the two phenomena are temporally correlated. Collectively, these findings help us better understand the relationships of multisensory stimulation, subjective ownership, and proprioceptive drift in the rubber hand illusion.},

	abstract = {Inspired by recent technological advances in the gaming industry, we used capture cards to create and LIVE-stream high quality 3D-images. With this novel technique, we developed a real-life stereoscopic 3D full-body illusion paradigm (3D projection). Unlike previous versions of the full-body illusion that rely upon unwieldy head-mounted displays, this paradigm enables the unobstructed investigation of such illusions with neuroscience methods (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography, and near-infrared spectroscopy) and examination of their neural underpinnings. This paper has three aims: (i) to provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement 3D LIVE-streaming, (ii) to explain how this can be used to create a full-body illusion paradigm; and (iii) to present evidence that documents the effectiveness of our methods (de Boer et al., 2020), including suggestions for potential applications. Particularly significant is the fact that 3D LIVE-streaming is not GPU-intensive and can easily be applied to any device or screen that can display 3D images (e.g., TV, tablet, mobile phone). Therefore, these methods also have potential future clinical and commercial benefits. 3D LIVE-streaming could be used to enhance future clinical observations or educational tools, or potentially guide medical interventions with real-time high-quality 3D images. Alternatively, our methods can be used in future rehabilitation programs to aid recovery from nervous system injury (e.g., spinal cord injury, brain damage, limb loss) or in therapies aimed at alleviating psychosis symptoms. Finally, 3D LIVEstreaming could set a new standard for immersive online gaming as well as augmenting online and mobile experiences (e.g., video chat, social sharing/events).},

	abstract = {During childhood, the body undergoes rapid changes suggesting the need to constantly update body representation based on the integration of multisensory signals. Sensory experiences in critical periods of early development may have a signiﬁcant impact on the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the development of the sense of one’s own body. Speciﬁcally, preterm children are at risk for sensory processing difﬁculties, which may lead to speciﬁc vulnerability in binding together sensory information in order to modulate the representation of the bodily self. The present study aims to investigate the malleability of body ownership in preterm (N = 21) and full-term (N = 19) school-age children, as reﬂected by sensitivity to the Rubber Hand Illusion. The results revealed that multisensory processes underlying the ability to identify a rubber hand as being part of one’s own body are already established in childhood, as indicated by a higher subjective feeling of embodiment over the rubber hand during synchronous visual-tactile stimulation. Notably, the effect of visual-tactile synchrony was related to the suppression of the alpha band oscillations over frontal, central, and parietal scalp regions, possibly indicating a greater activation of somatosensory and associative areas underpinning the illusory body ownership. Moreover, an interaction effect between visual-tactile condition and group emerged, suggesting that preterm children showed a greater suppression of alpha oscillatory activity during the illusion. This result together with lower scores of subjective embodiment over the rubber hand reported by preterm children indicate that preterm birth may affect the development of the ﬂexible representation of the body. These ﬁndings provide an essential contribution to better understand the processes of identiﬁcation and differentiation of the bodily self from the external environment, in both full-term and preterm children, paving the way for a multisensory and embodied approach to the investigation of social and cognitive development.},

The present study addresses this issue, showing that the ownership of a novel hand affects the conscious visual perception of the size of the really owned hand. Through a series of experiments in healthy adults, we assess how the embodiment of fake hands of different sizes (i.e., Rubber Hand Illusion, RHI) affects visual size estimation of the own hand. Our results demonstrate that the embodiment of a fake hand bigger in size than the own hand (Experiment 1), but not of a smaller fake hand (Experiment 2), affects the perception of similarity in size between the own hand and a visual model of the own hand, with a tendency toward an overestimation of the size of the hand exposed to the RHI (Experiment 1). The illusory ownership of a bigger hand does not affect the visual estimate of object size (Experiment 3). These ﬁndings show the tight link between the body image and the sense of ownership, the latter being able to change stored representations of body-parts size.

	abstract = {The unique ability to identify one’s own body and experience it as one’s own is fundamental in goal-oriented behavior and survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the so-called body ownership are yet not fully understood. Evidence based on Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) paradigms has demonstrated that body ownership is a product of reception and integration of self and externally generated multisensory information, feedforward and feedback processing of sensorimotor signals, and prior knowledge about the body. Crucially, however, these designs commonly involve the processing of proximal modalities while the contribution of distal sensory signals to the experience of ownership remains elusive. Here we propose that, like any robust percept, body ownership depends on the integration and prediction across all sensory modalities, including distal sensory signals pertaining to the environment. To test our hypothesis, we created an embodied goal-oriented Virtual Air Hockey Task, in which participants were to hit a virtual puck into a goal. In two conditions, we manipulated the congruency of distal multisensory cues (auditory and visual) while preserving proximal and action-driven signals entirely predictable. Compared to a fully congruent condition, our results revealed a signiﬁcant decrease on three dimensions of ownership evaluation when distal signals were incongruent, including the subjective report as well as physiological and kinematic responses to an unexpected threat. Together, these ﬁndings support the notion that the way we represent our body is contingent upon all the sensory stimuli, including distal and action-independent signals. The present data extend the current framework of body ownership and may also ﬁnd applications in rehabilitation scenarios.},

	abstract = {Body re-sizing illusions can profoundly alter perception of our own body. We investigated whether creating the illusion of a muscled and fit-looking back (Strong) influenced perceived back size, body ownership, and attitudes towards self-capacity during a lifting task. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers performed a standardised lifting task while viewing real-time (delay {\textless} 20 ms) video of their own back through a head-mounted display under four different conditions (Normal size, Strong, Reshaped, Large; order randomised). The MIRAGE-mediated reality system was used to modify the shape, size, and morphology of the back. Participants were poor at recognizing the correct appearance of their back, for both implicit (perceived width of shoulders and hips) and explicit (questionnaire) measures of back size. Visual distortions of body shape (Reshaped condition) altered implicit back size measures. However, viewing a muscled back (Strong condition) did not result in a sense of agency or ownership and did not update implicit perception of the back. No conditions improved perceptions/ attitudes of self-capacity (perceived back strength, perceived lifting confidence, and perceived back fitness). The results lend support for the importance of the embodiment of bodily changes to induce changes in perception. Further work is warranted to determine whether increased exposure to illusory changes would alter perceptions and attitudes towards self-capacity or whether different mechanisms are involved.},

However, existing control methods for subjective report measures (asynchronous stroking and control statements) are confounded by participant hypothesis awareness; the report may reflect response to demand characteristics. Subjective report is often accompanied by indirect (also called ‘objective’ or ‘implicit’) measures. Here, we report tests of expectancies for synchronous ‘illusion’ and asynchronous ‘control’ conditions across two pre-registered studies (

Expectancies for synchronous condition measures were greater than for asynchronous conditions in both studies. Differences between synchronous and asynchronous control condition measures are therefore confounded by hypothesis awareness. This means indirect measures of RH effects may reflect compliance, bias and phenomenological control in response to demand characteristics, just as for subjective measures. Valid control measures are required to support claims of a role of multisensory integration for both direct and indirect measures of RH effects.},

              Previous research has shown that emotions can alter our sense of ownership. Whether this relationship is modulated by differences in emotion experience and awareness, however, remains unclear. We investigated this by comparing the susceptibility to the rubber hand illusion (RHI) between participants who were either exposed to a low-arousing emotion induction (sadness) or placed in a neutral control group. Several factors that might influence this relationship were considered: dissociative symptoms were included to observe if a sadness induction led to a higher RHI score in participants scoring high in dissociation, as a result of detached emotion experience. Whether the level of awareness of the emotion mattered was also tested, as subliminal processing was shown to require less focal attention. Therefore, our sample (
              N
               = 122) was divided into three experimental groups: Sad pictures were presented to two of the three groups differing in presentation mode (subliminal:
              n
               = 40, supraliminal:
              n
               = 41), neutral pictures were presented supraliminally to the control group (
              n
               = 41). Additionally, the effects of slow (3 cm/s) and fast (30 cm/s) stroking, applied either synchronously or asynchronously, were examined as the comforting effects of stroking might interfere with the emotion induction. Results showed that the supraliminal sadness induction was associated with a stronger subjective illusion, but not with a higher proprioceptive drift compared to the subliminal induction. In addition, a stronger subjective illusion after fast and synchronous stroking was found compared to slow and asynchronous stroking. A significant proprioceptive drift was detected independent of group and stroking style. Both slow and synchronous stroking were perceived as more comforting than their respective counterparts. Participants with higher dissociative symptoms were more susceptible to the subjective illusion, especially in the supraliminal group in the synchronous condition. We concluded that individual differences in emotion experience are likely to play a role in body ownership. However, we cannot clarify at this stage whether differences in proprioception and the subjective illusion depend on the type of emotion experienced (e.g. different levels of arousal) and on concomitant changes in multisensory integration processes.},

Experiment 2 (n = 30) investigated the effect of providing verbal or tactile cues to guide participants’ attention to their upper limbs. On their own, neither interoceptive accuracy and sensibility or verbal and tactile cueing had an effect on the grasp illusion. However, verbal cueing increased the strength of the grasp illusion in individuals with lower interoceptive ability. Across the observed range of interoceptive accuracy and sensibility, verbal cueing decreased perceived index spacing by 5.6 cm [1.91 to 9.38] (mean [95\%CI]), and perceived ownership by ∼3 points on a 7-point Likert scale (slope -0.93 [-1.72 to -0.15]). Thus, attending to the upper limbs via verbal cues increases the strength of the grasp illusion in a way that is inversely proportional to a person’s level of interoceptive accuracy and sensibility.},

Presumably, the illusion can work as long as the false body part’s position and appearance are anatomically plausible.

When a participant moves their physical hand, they see the incongruent virtual hand moving. The result is an anatomically implausible conﬁguration of the fake hand. Despite the hand switch, participants reported signiﬁcant body ownership sensations over the virtual hands. In the ﬁrst between-group experiment, we found that the strength of body ownership over the incongruent hands was similar to that of congruent hands. Whereas, in the second within-group experiment, anatomical incongruency signiﬁcantly decreased body ownership. Still, participants reported signiﬁcant body ownership sensations of the switched hands. Curiously, we found that perceived levels of agency mediate the effect of anatomical congruency on body ownership. These ﬁndings offer a fresh perspective on the relationship between anatomical plausibility and assumed body ownership. We propose that goal-directed and purposeful actions can override anatomical plausibility constraints and discuss this in the context of the immersive properties of virtual reality.},

RHI strength is mainly assessed using a questionnaire rating and proprioceptive drift (PD). PD is characterized by the proprioceptively sensed location of the participant’s own hand shifting toward the location of the fake hand after RHI. However, the relationship between the two measures of hand ownership and location remains controversial due to mixed findings: some studies report correlations between them, while others show that they are independent. Here, we demonstrated significant PD without RHI using delayed visual feedback. In this RHI study, video images of the fake hand were delivered to the subjects, and four delay intervals of visual feedback (80, 280, 480, and 680 ms) were introduced. In four of six conditions, the delay interval was fixed throughout the condition. In the other two conditions, four delays were delivered in a predetermined order (i.e., serial condition; higher predictability) or in a pseudo-random order (i.e., random condition; low predictability). For the four conditions with a fixed delay, the questionnaire ratings and PD declined significantly when the delay interval exceeded circa 300 ms. In both the serial and random conditions, no illusory ownership of the fake hand was reported in the questionnaire. In contrast, greater PD was found in the random condition but not in the serial condition. Our findings suggest that hand ownership and localization are caused by distinct multisensory integration processes.},

The Virtual Hand Illusion (VHI) has been used to investigate multisensory contributions to embodiment, but has never been evaluated in older adults. Spatio-temporal factors unique to virtual environments may differentially affect the embodied perceptions of older and younger adults.
Methods: Twenty-one younger (18–35 years) and 19 older (65+ years) adults completed the VHI paradigm. Body localization was measured at baseline and again, with subjective ownership ratings, following synchronous and asynchronous visual-tactile interactions.
Results: Higher ownership ratings were observed in the synchronous relative to the asynchronous condition, but no effects on localization/drift were found. No age differences were observed. Localization accuracy was biased in both age groups when the virtual hand was aligned with the real hand, indicating a visual mislocalization of the virtual hand.
Conclusions: No age-related differences in the VHI were observed. Mislocalization of the hand in VR occurred for both groups, even when congruent and aligned; however, tactile feedback reduced localization biases. Our results expand the current understanding of age-related changes in multisensory embodiment within virtual environments.},

              The illusion of having a large body makes us perceive objects as smaller than they really are. This action-specific perception effect occurs because we perceive the property of an object (i.e., size) differently according to our unique action capability (i.e., the affordance of body size). Although the body-ownership illusion contributing to this action-specific perception has been studied, its effects remain unclear in neurological patients. We examined the action-specific perception impairments of MCI patients by means of body-ownership illusion in a non-immersive virtual reality environment. Twenty healthy young adults, 21 healthy older adults, and 15 MCI patients were recruited. We assessed their “original-body action-specific perception” and “enlarged-body action-specific perception” using the original and enlarged sizes of their virtual bodies, respectively. The MCI patients’ original-body action-specific perception was no different than that of the healthy controls (
              p
               = 0.679). However, the enlarged-body action-specific perception of the MCI patients was significantly biased (
              p
               {\textless} 0.001). The inclusion of the enlarged-body action-specific perception provides additional discriminative power for early diagnosis of MCI (89.3\% accuracy, 75.0\% sensitivity, 100.0\% specificity, and 87.5\% balanced accuracy).},

Previous studies investigating the neural responses evoked by the illusion-inducing stimulation have provided diverging reports as to when these responses reflect the illusory state of the artificial limb becoming embodied. One reason for these diverging reports may be that different studies contrasted different experimental conditions to isolate potential correlates of the illusion, but individual contrasts may reflect multiple facets of the adopted experimental paradigm and not just the illusory state. To resolve these controversies, we recorded EEG responses in human participants and combined multivariate (cross-)classification with multiple Illusion and nonIllusion conditions. These conditions were designed to probe for markers of the illusory state that generalize across the spatial arrangements of limbs or the specific nature of the control object (a rubber hand or participant’s real hand), hence which are independent of the precise experimental conditions used as contrast for the illusion. Our results reveal a parcellation of evoked responses into a temporal sequence of events. Around 125 and 275 ms following stimulus onset, the neurophysiological signals reliably differentiate the illusory state from non-Illusion epochs. These results consolidate previous work by demonstrating multiple neurophysiological correlates of the rubber hand illusion and illustrate how multivariate approaches can help pinpointing those that are independent of the precise experimental configuration used to induce the illusion.},

Sensing the mannequin’s body as one’s own during encoding enhanced the following factors: memory accuracy across testing points, immediate reliving, delayed emotional intensity, vividness, and belief in memory accuracy. These ﬁndings demonstrate that a basic sense of bodily selfhood provides a crucial foundation for the accurate reliving of the past.},

            The widely used rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm provides insight into how the brain manages conflicting multisensory information regarding bodily self-consciousness. Previous functional neuroimaging studies have revealed that the feeling of body ownership is linked to activity in the premotor cortex, the intraparietal areas, the occipitotemporal cortex, and the insula. The current study investigated whether the individual differences in the sensation of body ownership over a rubber hand, as measured by subjective report and the proprioceptive drift, are associated with structural brain differences in terms of cortical thickness in 67 healthy young adults. We found that individual differences measured by the subjective report of body ownership are associated with the cortical thickness in the somatosensory regions, the temporo-parietal junction, the intraparietal areas, and the occipitotemporal cortex, while the proprioceptive drift is linked to the premotor area and the anterior cingulate cortex. These results are in line with functional neuroimaging studies indicating that these areas are indeed involved in processes such as cognitive-affective perspective taking, visual processing of the body, and the experience of body ownership and bodily awareness. Consequently, these individual differences in the sensation of body ownership are pronounced in both functional and structural differences.},

This illusion largely rests on bottom-up (automatic multisensory and perceptual integration) mechanisms. However, the relative contribution from top-down factors, such as controlled processes involving attentional regulation, remains unclear. Following previous work that highlights the putative influence of higher-order cognition in the RHI, we aimed to further examine how modulations of working memory load and task instructions—two conditions engaging topdown cognitive processes—influence the experience of the RHI, as indexed by a number of psychometric dimensions. Relying on exploratory factor analysis for assessing this phenomenology within the RHI, our results confirm the influence of higher-order, top-down mental processes. Whereas task instruction strongly modulated embodiment of the rubber hand, cognitive load altered the affective dimension of the RHI. Our findings corroborate that top-down processes shape the phenomenology of the RHI and herald new ways to improve experimental control over the RHI.},

	abstract = {The sense of body ownership, the feeling that one’s own body belongs to oneself, is generated from the integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information. However, long-term non-use of parts of the body due to physical dysfunction caused by trauma or illness may disturb multisensory integration, resulting in a decreased sense of body ownership. The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an experimental method of manipulating the sense of ownership (SoO). In this illusion, subjects feel as if the rubber hand in front of them were their own hand. The RHI elicits the disownership phenomenon; not only does the rubber hand feels like one’s own hand, but one’s own hand does not feel like one’s own hand. The decrease of ownership of one’s own body induced by the bodily illusion is accompanied by neurophysiological changes, such as attenuation of somatosensory evoked potential and decreases in skin temperature. If the loss of the SoO is associated with decreased neurophysiological function, the dysfunction of patients complaining of the loss of ownership can be exacerbated; appropriate rehabilitation prescriptions are urgently required. The present study attempted to induce a sense of disownership of subjects’ own hands using the RHI and investigated whether the tactile sensitivity threshold was altered by disownership. Via questionnaire, subjects reported a decrease of ownership after the RHI manipulation; at the same time, tactile sensitivity thresholds were shown to increase in tactile evaluation using the Semmes-Weinstein monoﬁlaments test. The tactile detection rate changes before and after the RHI were negatively correlated with the disownership-score changes. These results show that subjects’ sense of disownership, that their own hands did not belong to them, led to decreases in tactile sensitivity. The study ﬁndings also suggest that manipulating of illusory ownership can be a tool for estimating the degree of exacerbation of sensory impairment in patients. Consideration of new interventions that optimize the sense of body ownership may contribute to new rehabilitation strategies for post-stroke sensory impairment.},

	abstract = {To offer engaging neurorehabilitation training to neurologic patients, motor tasks are often visualized in virtual reality (VR). Recently introduced head-mounted displays (HMDs) allow to realistically mimic the body of the user from a first-person perspective (i.e., avatar) in a highly immersive VR environment. In this immersive environment, users may embody avatars with different body characteristics. Importantly, body characteristics impact how people perform actions. Therefore, alternating body perceptions using immersive VR may be a powerful tool to promote motor activity in neurologic patients. However, the ability of the brain to adapt motor commands based on a perceived modified reality has not yet been fully explored. To fill this gap, we “tricked the brain” using immersive VR and investigated if multisensory feedback modulating the physical properties of an embodied avatar influences motor brain networks and control. Ten healthy participants were immersed in a virtual environment using an HMD, where they saw an avatar from first-person perspective. We slowly transformed the surface of the avatar (i.e., the “skin material”) from human to stone. We enforced this visual change by repetitively touching the real arm of the participant and the arm of the avatar with a (virtual) hammer, while progressively replacing the sound of the hammer against skin with stone hitting sound via loudspeaker. We applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic simulation (TMS) to evaluate changes in motor cortical excitability associated with the illusion. Further, to investigate if the “stone illusion” affected motor control, participants performed a reaching task with the human and stone avatar. Questionnaires assessed the subjectively reported strength of embodiment and illusion. Our results show that participants experienced the “stone arm illusion.” Particularly, they rated their arm as heavier, colder, stiffer, and more insensitive when immersed with the stone than human avatar, without the illusion affecting their experienced feeling of body ownership. Further, the reported illusion strength was associated with enhanced motor cortical excitability and faster movement initiations, indicating that participants may have physically mirrored and compensated for the embodied body characteristics of the stone avatar. Together, immersive VR has the potential to influence motor brain networks by subtly modifying the perception of reality, opening new perspectives for the motor recovery of patients.},

These findings stem from research where an experimenter induced the body illusions. In line with advances in the domains of videogames and virtual reality where the real body is used as a controller we investigate if these consequences also accompany self-generated body illusions. In two preregistered experiments we made use of a head-mounted display set-up to induce the full body illusion (FBI) whereby touch is felt to originate from a 3PP body, and examined effects in the simple detection of supra-threshold vibrotactile stimuli presented to the participants' back and head. Results of both experiments indicate that it is possible to induce a FBI through self-stroking of the neck and that the FBI is accompanied by reduced accuracy and delayed reaction times in detection of somatosensory stimuli. In an additional preregistered control experiment the alternative explanation that a difference in motion presented in the conditions was responsible for these findings was ruled out. Our findings corroborate previous studies that have found body illusions to be accompanied by bodily consequences and further extend these findings to the domain of self-induced body illusions. These results are relevant for video games and VR setups that are geared towards virtual embodiment as they advance our understanding of the conditions and mechanisms in which bodily consequences may express themselves.},

However, it is not clear whether visual self-recognition inﬂuences susceptibility to the RHI, although evidence for individual diﬀerences in the perceptual body image on the RHI suggests that this may be the case. We investigated the role of self-recognition on the subjective experience of the RHI and measured proprioceptive drift and onset time of the RHI between two groups, one with the ability to identify an image of their own hand and the other without this ability. A typical RHI response was found overall with no group diﬀerence in the subjective experience of the RHI. However, a larger proprioceptive drift and an earlier onset time for the RHI was found for the non-recognisers than the self-recognition group.

            Illusory body ownership can be induced in a body part or a full body by visual-motor synchronisation. A previous study indicated that an invisible full body illusion can be induced by the synchronous movement of only the hands and feet. The difference between body part ownership and the full body illusion has not been explained in detail because there is no method for separating these two illusions. To develop a method to do so, we scrambled or randomised the positions of the hands and feet and compared it with the normal layout stimulus by manipulating visual-motor synchronisation. In Experiment 1, participants observed the stimuli from a third-person perspective, and the questionnaire results showed that the scrambled body stimulus induced only body part ownership, while the normal layout stimulus induced both body part ownership and full body ownership when the stimuli were synchronous with participants’ actions. In Experiment 2, we found similar results as with the first-person perspective stimuli in a questionnaire. We did not find significant skin conductance response difference between any conditions in either Experiment 2 or 3. These results suggest that a spatial relationship is necessary for the full body illusion, but not for body part ownership.},

            Body ownership (the feeling that one’s body belongs to oneself) is commonly studied with Rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm that allows inducing a temporary illusory feeling of ownership of a life-sized rubber hand. However, it remains unclear whether illusory ownership of the fake hand relies on the same mechanisms as ownership of one’s own real hand. Here, we directly compared ownership of the own hand (OH) and fake hand (FH) in the same set of conditions within immersive virtual reality. We obtained behavioral (proprioceptive drift) and subjective (questionnaire) measures of ownership and disownership for virtual OH, FH and object (Obj) that were located congruently or incongruently with the participant’s real hand and were stimulated synchronously or asynchronously with the real hand. Both OH and FH (but not Obj) were embodied after synchronous stimulation in both locations. Crucially, subjective ownership of the OH was stronger than of the FH in congruent location after synchronous stimulation. It was also present after asynchronous stimulation, being stronger when the virtual OH was subjectively more similar to the real hand. The results suggest that the detailed appearance of the body might act as an additional component in the construction of body ownership.},

            Body ownership can be experimentally investigated with the rubber hand illusion (RHI), in which watching a rubber hand stroked synchronously with one’s own hidden hand induces a feeling of ownership over the rubber hand. The aim of this study was to investigate response to the RHI in high (N = 21) and low (N = 19) hypnotizable individuals in normal waking state and in hypnosis. Response to the RHI was measured via a question on the illusory feeling of ownership and with proprioceptive drift. The Highs expressed an overall feeling of more ownership over the rubber hand in both the normal waking state and hypnosis, although both groups gave higher ownership scores after synchronous than after asynchronous stroking and the difference between conditions was similar across groups. Conversely, the proprioceptive drift appeared to be differentially modulated by hypnosis and hypnotic suggestibility: it was increased in the Highs and decreased in the Lows after hypnosis induction. These findings hint at an interplay between hypnotic suggestibility and hypnosis in modulating response to the RHI. The selective breakdown of proprioceptive drift among the Lows suggests resistance to recalibrate one’s own limb in hypnosis.},

Studies indicate that vision plays a fundamental role in modulating such illusions. In our current study, we used immersive virtual reality (IVR) to investigate the role of body-related visual feedback in modulating illusory sensation of movement in the left arm. Thirty healthy participants were asked to evaluate the onset of motor illusion and four illusion-related features (vividness, duration, extension and aftereffect), in the presence and absence of real and virtual visual feedback. Additionally, subjective reports of the embodiment illusion (the sense of embodying a virtual surrogate) were collected in virtual conditions. Results showed a progressive decrease in the perception of the motor illusion along a continuum ranging from the absence of visual feedback (maximal illusory perception) to the observation of one’s own real arm (minimal illusory perception). Interestingly, the appearance of the virtual limbs affected the movement illusion differently. Specifically, TV evoked a stronger kinesthetic illusion when observing the virtual hand detached from the limb than during the observation of the virtual full limb and virtual object. This suggests that a closer visual resemblance between the virtual and real limb results in a greater effect on proprioceptive processing. However, no significant correlation was found between the illusion of arm movement and the illusion of embodiment, indicating that the two phenomena may not be directly related. These findings provide new insight into the role of body-related visual feedback in modulating motor illusions.},

	abstract = {Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) not only experience a strong instability in their affect and interpersonal relations but also disturbances in their self-experience, including dissociation and body-alienation symptoms. It is not yet understood whether an altered sense of ownership (SoO) or sense of agency (SoA) may contribute to these disturbances. One recent hypothesis is that patients with BPD have a reduced sense of self and are therefore more likely to misattribute external objects or actions to their own self than healthy individuals. The present study followed up this hypothesis by investigating whether BPD patients have a more ﬂexible body representation than healthy participants. More speciﬁcally, the active rubber hand illusion (aRHI) was applied to 21 patients with BPD and the same number of healthy participants. Using established subjective, electrodermal, and behavioral measures, the participants’ SoO and SoA were assessed during the aRHI. The ﬁndings show self-reported evidence for higher SoO under anatomical hand congruency as compared to anatomical incongruency, but no evidence for group differences between BPD patients and healthy participants. This ﬁnding is inconsistent with previous ﬁndings of an enhanced SoO-related body plasticity in BPD patients. Regarding SoA, the ﬁndings show self-report evidence of higher SoA in BPD patients versus healthy participants, although this group difference was not evident in the implicit SoA measure (intentional binding). In summary, the present study only reveals partial evidence for a higher body plasticity in BPD patients. Instead, the observed variability in results appears better explainable by some generally elevated perceptual suggestibility of BPD individuals.},

	abstract = {The Full body illusion (FBI) is an illusion in which participants experience a change in self-location to a body that is perceived from a third-person perspective. The FBI is usually induced through experimenter generated stroking but can also be induced through self-generated stroking. In four experiments (three preregistered) we compared a self-generated stroking induction condition to a self-generated movement condition, where the only difference between conditions was the presence or absence of touch. We investigated whether the illusion reflects an all-or-nothing phenomenon or whether the illusion is influenced by the availability of synchronous information in an additional sensory modality. As a prerequisite, we investigated whether the FBI can also be induced using just self-generated movement in the absence of synchronous touch. Illusion strength was measured through illusion statements. Participants reported an equally strong illusion for both induction methods in Experiments 1, 2 and 3. In the third experiment, we additionally measured the time of illusion onset. Like the illusion strength measures, the illusion onset times did not differ between the two induction methods. In the fourth experiment participants only completed the self-generated movement condition. Again, they reported the FBI, demonstrating that the findings of Experiments 1, 2 and 3 were not dependent on the presence of a condition that used synchronous touch. Together, these findings confirm the hypothesis that the FBI is an all-or-nothing phenomenon and that adding additional multisensory synchronicity does not help to enhance the strength, onset time or onset probability of the illusion.},

Recent accounts of the RHI have suggested that the illusion would only occur if weighting of conflicting sensory information and their subsequent integration results in a statistically plausible compromise. In three different experiments, we investigated the role of distance between the two hands as well as their proximity to the body’s midline in influencing the occurrence of the illusion. Overall, the results suggest that the illusion is abolished when placing the two hands apart, therefore increasing the mismatch between the visual and proprioceptive modality, whereas the proximity of the two hands to the body’s midline plays only a minor role on the subjective report of the illusion. This might be driven by the response properties of visuotactile bimodal cells encoding the peripersonal space around the hand.},

	abstract = {How our brain represents our body through the integration of internal and external sensory information so that we can interact with our surrounding environment has become a matter of interest especially in the field of neurorehabilitation. In this regard, there is an increasing interest in the use of multisensory integration techniques—such as the use of body ownership illusions—to modulate distorted body representations after brain damage. In particular, cross-modal illusions such as mirror visual feedback therapy (MVFT) have been widely used for motor rehabilitation. Despite the effectiveness of the MVFT for motor rehabilitation, there are some limitations to fully modify the distorted internal representation of the paretic limb in patients with stroke. A possible explanation for this relies on the physical limitations of the mirror in reproducing upper-limb distortions, which can result in a reduced sense of ownership of the mirrored limb. New digital technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and 360° videos allow researchers to create body ownership illusions by adapting virtual bodies so that they represent specific morphological characteristics including upper-limb distortions. In this manuscript, we present a new rehabilitation approach that employs full virtual body ownership illusions, using a 360° video system, for the assessment and modulation of the internal representation of the affected upper limb in stroke patients. We suggest modifying the internal representation of the upper limb to a normal position before starting motor rehabilitation training.},

Previous studies demonstrated that VMI activates the motor association brain areas; however, it is unclear whether VMI immediately alters the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). This study is aimed to verify whether the VMI induction changed the RSFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The right hands of 13 healthy adults underwent illusion and observation conditions for 20 min each. Before and after each condition, RSFC was measured using fNIRS. After each condition, degree of kinesthetic illusion and a sense of body ownership measured using the Likert scale. Our results indicated that, compared with the observation condition, the degree of kinesthetic illusion and the sense of body ownership were significantly higher after the illusion condition. Compared with the observation condition, RSFC after the illusion condition significantly increased brain areas associated with kinesthetic illusion, a sense of body ownership, and motor execution. In conclusion, RSFC has become a biomarker that shows changes in brain function occurring due to VMI. VMI may be applied to the treatment of patients with stroke or orthopedic diseases.},

Although these measures often correlate, research from the visual RHI suggests that they reflect separate underlying processes. We investigated whether increasing the duration of tactile stimulation would affect PD and questionnaires differently during the somatic RHI. Participants experienced 30 s, 2 min, or 5 min of synchronous or asyn­ chronous tactile stimulation. Increasing duration affected only PD, with increased drift following 5 min vs 30 s of stimulation.

Related literature points to competing predictions relative to how symptoms of social anxiety potentially impact susceptibility to the RHI.

Furthermore, the perception of multisensory timing, which is thought to be fundamental for body perception, is altered in schizophrenia. We tested whether altered perception of the temporal relationship between visual and tactile signals in schizophrenia predicts self-reported perceptual aberrations and RHI susceptibility. We found that the sensitivity to detect temporal asynchronies is reduced in schizophrenia and this is a signiﬁcant predictor for bodily perceptual symptoms. In contrast, we found no evidence for a direct relationship between asynchrony detection sensitivity and RHI susceptibility. Instead, our ﬁndings suggest that experiencing more bodily perceptual symptoms increases the likelihood of endorsing unusual bodily experiences, resulting in higher RHI self-ratings but not higher proprioceptive drift scores.

            Virtual reality (VR) enables the fast, free, and highly controllable setting of experimental body images. Illusions pertaining to a body, such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI), can be easily conducted in VR settings, and some phenomena, such as full-body illusions, are only realized in virtual environments. However, the multisensory-integration process in VR is not yet fully understood. Thus, it remains to be clarified if specific phenomena that occur under VR settings manifest in real life as well. One useful investigative approach is measuring brain activities during a psychological experiment. Electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory activities provide insight into the human multisensory integration process. Nevertheless, EEG data can be vulnerable to VR noise, which causes measurement and analytical difficulties for EEG data recorded in VR environments. Here, we achieve an experimental RHI setting using a head-mounted display that provides a VR visual space and VR dummy hand along with EEG measurements. We compared EEG data collected in both real and VR environments and observed the gamma and theta band oscillatory activities. Ultimately, we observed statistically significant differences between congruent (RHI) and incongruent (not RHI) conditions in the real environment, which is consistent with previous studies. Differences in the VR condition were observed only on the late theta band oscillation, suggesting that the VR setting itself altered the perceptual and sensory integration mechanisms.

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that it is possible to use multisensory stimulation to induce the perceptual illusion of owning supernumerary limbs, such as two right arms. However, it remains unclear whether the coherent feeling of owning a full-body may be duplicated in the same manner and whether such a dual full-body illusion could be used to split the unitary sense of self-location into two. Here, we examined whether healthy human participants can experience simultaneous ownership of two full-bodies, located either close in parallel or in two separate spatial locations. A previously described full-body illusion, based on visuo-tactile stimulation of an artificial body viewed from the first-person perspective (1PP) via head-mounted displays, was adapted to a dual-body setting and quantified in five experiments using questionnaires, a behavioural self-location task and threat-evoked skin conductance responses. The results of experiments 1–3 showed that synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation of two bodies viewed from the 1PP lying in parallel next to each other induced a significant illusion of dual full-body ownership. In experiment 4, we failed to find support for our working hypothesis that splitting the visual scene into two, so that each of the two illusory bodies was placed in distinct spatial environments, would lead to dual self-location. In a final exploratory experiment (no. 5), we found preliminary support for an illusion of dual self-location and dual body ownership by using dynamic changes between the 1PPs of two artificial bodies and/or a common third-person perspective in the ceiling of the testing room. These findings suggest that healthy people, under certain conditions of multisensory perceptual ambiguity, may experience dual body ownership and dual self-location. These findings suggest that the coherent sense of the bodily self located at a single place in space is the result of an active and dynamic perceptual integration process.},

	abstract = {The full-body ownership illusion exploits multisensory perception to induce a feeling of ownership of an entire artificial body. Although previous research has shown that synchronous visuotactile stimulation of a single body part is sufficient for illusory ownership of the whole body, the effect of combining multisensory stimulation across multiple body parts remains unknown. Therefore, 48 healthy adults participated in a full-body ownership illusion with conditions involving synchronous (illusion) or asynchronous (control) visuotactile stimulation to one, two, or three body parts simultaneously (2×3 design). We used questionnaires to isolate illusory ownership of five specific body parts (left arm, right arm, trunk, left leg, right leg) from the full-body ownership experience and sought to test not only for increased ownership in synchronous versus asynchronous conditions but also for potentially varying degrees of full-body ownership illusion intensity related to the number of body parts stimulated. Illusory full-body ownership and all five body-part ownership ratings were significantly higher following synchronous stimulation than asynchronous stimulation (p-values {\textless} .01). Since nonstimulated body parts also received significantly increased ownership ratings following synchronous stimulation, the results are consistent with an illusion that engages the entire body. Furthermore, we noted that ownership ratings for right body parts (which were often but not always stimulated in this experiment) were significantly higher than ownership ratings for left body parts (which were never stimulated). Regarding the effect of stimulating multiple body parts simultaneously on explicit full-body ownership ratings, there was no evidence of a significant main effect of the number of stimulations (p = .850) or any significant interaction with stimulation synchronicity (p = .160), as assessed by linear mixed modelling. Instead, median ratings indicated a moderate affirmation (+1) of an illusory full-body sensation in all three synchronous conditions, a finding mirrored by comparable full-body illusion onset times. In sum, illusory full-body ownership appears to be an ‘all-or-nothing’ phenomenon and depends upon the synchronicity of visuotactile stimulation, irrespective of the number of stimulated body parts.},

	abstract = {When people hold implicit biases against a group they typically engage in discriminatory behaviour against group members. In the context of the implicit racial bias of ‘White' against ‘Black' people, it has been shown several times that implicit bias is reduced after a short exposure of embodiment in a dark-skinned body in virtual reality. Embodiment usually leads to the illusion of ownership over the virtual body, irrespective of its skin colour. Previous studies have been carried out in virtual scenarios that are affectively neutral or positive. Here, we show that when the scenario is affectively negative the illusion of body ownership of White participants over a White body is lessened, and implicit bias is higher for White participants in a Black virtual body. The study was carried out with 92 White female participants, in a between-groups design with two factors: BodyType (their virtual body was White or Black) and a surrounding Crowd was Negative, Neutral or Positive towards the participant. We argue that negative affect prevents the formation of new positive associations with Black and distress leads to disownership of the virtual body. Although virtual reality is often thought of as an ‘empathy machine' our results suggest caution, that this may not be universally the case.},

Touches are synchronously applied to the real hand, hidden from view, and a false hand in an anatomically congruent position. During the illusion one may perceive that the feeling of touch arises from the false hand (referral of touch), and that the false hand is one’s own. The relationship between referral of touch and body ownership in the illusion is unclear, and some articles average responses to statements addressing these experiences, which may be inappropriate depending on the research question of interest. To address these concerns, we re-analyzed three freely available datasets to better understand the relationship between referral of touch and feeling of ownership in the RHI. We found that most participants who report a feeling of ownership also report referral of touch, and that referral of touch and ownership show a moderately strong positive relationship that was highly replicable. In addition, referral of touch tends to be reported more strongly and more frequently than the feeling of ownership over the hand. The former observations conﬁrm that referral of touch and ownership are related experiences in the RHI. The latter, however, indicate that when pooling the statements one may obtain a higher number of illusion ‘responders’ compared to considering the ownership statements in isolation. These results have implications for the RHI as an experimental paradigm.},

              The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) opened the investigation of the sense of body ownership in healthy people. By putting in slight contrast vision touch and proprioception, healthy people embody a fake hand in one's body representation. The easiness of the procedure, typically measured with a set of questions that capture the subjective experience, favoured its blooming. However, validation studies of embodiment questionnaires are lacking, and the individual differences that contribute to the embodiment received little attention. In our study, 298 participants underwent an RHI procedure following both synchronous and asynchronous (control) visuo-tactile stimulations. The study had multiple aims: (a) to explore the psychometric structure of a 27-items questionnaire largely used in the literature; (b) to build a psychometrically efficient scale to measure embodiment-related phenomena; (c) to explore whether and how individual differences (empathy, self-esteem and mindfulness) are associated with the experience of illusion. We found a relatively simple structure consisting of three components:
              embodiment
              of the rubber hand,
              disembodiment
              of the biological hand,
              physical sensations
              experienced during the procedure. The scales designed were psychometrically reliable and theoretically meaningful, encompassing 18 of the original items. Finally, by adopting a network analysis approach, we found that the embodiment is directly related to empathy and self-esteem, while disembodiment and physical sensation are unrelated to individual personality traits. The study provides substantial evidence to use the embodiment scale as a standard questionnaire for future RHI studies. Additionally, the correlations with personality traits suggest that the embodiment induced by the RHI deeply integrates with the complexity of the individuals and their differences.},

This phenomenon, also known as (positive) affective touch, is likely to be the basis of afﬁliative interactions with conspeciﬁcs by promoting inter-individual bindings. Previous studies on healthy humans have demonstrated that affective touch can remarkably impact behavior. For instance, by administering the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) paradigm, the embodiment of a fake hand enhances after a slow, affective touch compared to a fast, neutral touch. However, results coming from this area are not univocal. In addition, there are no clues in the existing literature on the relationship between affective touch and the space around our body. To overcome these lacks, we carried out two separate experiments where participants underwent a RHI paradigm (Experiment 1) and a Visuo-Tactile Interaction task (Experiment 2), designed to tap into body representation and peripersonal space processing, respectively. In both experiments, an affective touch (CT-optimal, 3 cm/s) and neutral touch (CT-suboptimal, 18 cm/s) were delivered by the experimenter on the dorsal side of participants’ hand through a “skin to skin” contact. In Experiment 1, we did not ﬁnd any modulation of body representation—not at behavioral nor at a physiological level—by affective touch. In Experiment 2, no visuo-tactile spatial modulation emerged depending upon the pleasantness of the touch received. These null ﬁndings are interpreted in the light of the current scientiﬁc context where the real nature of affective touch is often misguided, and they offer the possibility to pave the way for understanding the real effects of affective touch on body/space representation.},

In this article, the effects of both external and voluntary self-touch on BSC were examined with a robotics-based FBI paradigm. We compared the effects of classical passive visuotactile stimulation and active self-touch (in which experimental participants had a sense of agency over the tactile stimulation) on the FBI. We evaluated these effects using a questionnaire, crossmodal congruency task, and measurements of changes in self-location. The results indicated that both synchronous passive visuotactile stimulation and synchronous active self-touch induced illusory ownership over a virtual body, without signiﬁcant differences in their magnitudes. However, the FBI induced by active self-touch was associated with a larger drift in self-location towards the virtual body. These results show that movement-related signals arising from self-touch impact the BSC not only for hand ownership but also for torso-centered body ownership and related aspects of BSC.},

In a mixed design experiment, 56 participants underwent through a full-body illusion protocol. During the experi­ ment, half of the participants received synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation, and the other half received asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation, while their physical body was lying in a supine position, but the virtual body was standing. Additionally, the contribution of individual sensory weighting strategies was investigated via the Rod and Frame task (RFT), which was applied both before (pre-FBI standing and pre-FBI supine) and after the full-body illusion (post-FBI supine) protocol. Subjective reports of the participants confirmed previous findings suggesting that there was a significant increase in ownership over a virtual body during synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation. Additionally, further categorization of participants based on their visual de­ pendency (by RFT) showed that those participants who rely more on visual information (visual field dependents) perceived the full-body illusion more strongly than non-visual field dependents during the synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation condition. Further analysis provided not only a quantitative demonstration of full-body illusion but also revealed changes in perceived selforientation based on their field dependency. Altogether, findings of the current study make further contributions to our understanding of the vestibular system and brought new insight for individual sensory weighting strategies during a full-body illusion.},

            The neural representation of the body is easily altered by the integration of multiple sensory signals in the brain. The “rubber hand illusion” (RHI) is one of the most popular experimental paradigms to investigate this phenomenon. During this illusion, a feeling of ownership of the rubber hand is created. Some studies have shown that somatosensory processing in the brain is attenuated when RHI occurs. However, it is unknown where attenuation of somatosensory processing occurs. Here, we show that somatosensory processing is attenuated in the primary somatosensory cortex. We found that the earliest response of somatosensory evoked potentials, which is thought to originate from the primary somatosensory cortex, was attenuated during RHI. Furthermore, this attenuation was observed before the occurrence of the illusion. Our results suggest that attenuation of sensory processing in the primary somatosensory cortex is one of the factors influencing the occurrence of the RHI.},

While the subjective embodiment of alien bodies of different sizes has been already manipulated with the FBI, it remains unexplored whether the body-metric perception is impacted too. We first developed a new setup for the FBI using 360° videos to favour the embodiment. The FBI was induced for bodies of three sizes adopting anatomical and non-anatomical viewpoints, and we measured the subjective embodiment. The results suggest that humans can embody normal size or bigger bodies seen from anatomical viewpoints, but not smaller ones. We then investigated if the FBI modulates the body-metric representation. We found that the resized bodies’ vision affects the perception of one’s body-metric representation, but this was independent of the embodiment, suggesting that the FBI alters the body representation at different levels with a specific impact.},

In the present study we tested the redundant signals effect (RSE) as a new objective measure of the illusion that was designed to directly tap into the multisensory integration underlying the illusion. The illusion was induced by an experimenter who stroked and tapped the participant’s shoulder and underarm, while participants perceived the touch on the virtual body in front of them via a head-mounted display. Participants performed a speeded detection task, responding to visual stimuli on the virtual body, to tactile stimuli on the real body and to combined (multisensory) visual and tactile stimuli. Analysis of the RSE with a race model inequality test indicated that multisensory integration took place in both the synchronous and the asynchronous condition. This surprising ﬁnding suggests that simultaneous bodily stimuli from different (visual and tactile) modalities will be transiently integrated into a multisensory representation even when no illusion is induced. Furthermore, this ﬁnding suggests that the RSE is not a suitable objective measure of body illusions. Interestingly however, responses to the unisensory tactile stimuli in the speeded detection task were found to be slower and had a larger variance in the asynchronous condition than in the synchronous condition. The implications of this ﬁnding for the literature on body representations are discussed.},

In this task, the participants had to choose which of the two right rubber hands in view felt most like their own, and the ownership discriminations were fitted to psy­ chometric curves. In the current study, we occluded the visual impressions of the object moving towards one of the rubber hands (during the first two-thirds of the path) and only revealed the final third of the object’s movement trajectory when it touched the rubber hand (approach-occluded condition). Alternatively, we occluded only the final part so that the main part of the movement towards the model hand was visible (touch-occluded). We compared these two conditions to an illusion baseline condition where the object was visible during the entire trajectory and contact (no-occlusion). The touch-occluded condition produced equally strong hand ownership as the baseline condition with no occlusion, while ownership perception was significantly reduced when vision of the object approaching the rubber hand was occluded (approach-occluded). Our results show that tactile predictions generated from seeing an object moving towards the body are temporally exact, and they contribute to the rubber hand illusion by integrating with temporally congruent afferent sensory signals. This finding highlights the importance of multisensory predictions in peripersonal space, object permanence, and the interplay between bottom-up sensory signals and top-down predictions in body ownership.},

	abstract = {People are assumed to represent themselves in terms of body ownership and agency. Studies using the rubber- or virtual-hand illusion have assessed ownership and agency by means of explicit ownership and agency ratings and implicit measures, like proprioceptive drift in the case of ownership. These measures often show similar effects but also some discrepancies, suggesting that they rely on data sources that overlap, but not completely. To systematically assess commonalities and discrepancies, we adopted an immersed virtual hand illusion (VHI) design, in which three independent factors were manipulated: the synchrony between the movement of real and virtual effector, the type of effector, which was a virtual hand or triangle, and the spatial congruency between the real and virtual effector. Commonalities and discrepancies in the effects of these factors were assessed by crossing explicit and implicit measures for ownership and agency. While standard ratings were used as explicit measures, implicit ownership was assessed by means of proprioceptive drift and implicit agency by means of intentional binding. Results showed similar effect patterns for the two agency measures, which, however, were not correlated, different effect patterns for the two ownership measures, and a strong correlation between the two explicit measures. Taken altogether, our findings suggest that explicit and implicit measures of ownership and agency partly rely on shared informational sources, but seem to differ with respect to other sources that are integrated or with respect to the processed dimension (shape vs. time). The findings also suggest that some findings obtained with RHI designs might reflect more the unnatural situation that that design puts individuals into rather than generalizable mechanisms of computing perceived ownership and agency.},

Bottom-up multisensory integration and top-down modulation were predicted to be important for ownership and agency. In previous studies, cognitive load was revealed to affect the sense of agency in a top-down fashion, but its effect on ownership has not been fully investigated, not even its possibly different effect on explicit and implicit measures. Here we used cognitive load (small vs. large sets in a working-memory task) to disentangle explicit and implicit measures of ownership and agency in a task inducing the virtual hand illusion (VHI; stronger perceived ownership and agency over a virtual hand if it moves in synchrony with one’s real hand). Results showed similar patterns for ownership and agency – both ownership and agency were affected by cognitive load, and importantly in the explicit measures, higher load increased the effect of synchrony (i.e., the VHI), but in implicit measures, higher load reduced indications of both ownership and agency. Hence, the load manipulation was selective with regard to the explicit versus implicit nature of the measure but not with respect to the measure’s content. This provides strong evidence that explicit and implicit measures of both ownership and agency rely on at least partly separable informational sources, while the difference between ownership and agency as such does not seem to play a major role.},

The present narrative review assesses the existing literature in these areas trying to identify their different levels of clinical evidence. Specifically, the review presents four clinical approaches based upon VR and their implications in the treatment of eating disorders: VR cue exposure, VR reference frame shifting, VR for correcting body distortions and attentional biases. In general, existing findings demonstrate the clinical value of VR. On one side, the present review suggests that two VR-based techniques—VR exposure and reference frame shifting—have a significant research support and provide a possible advantage over traditional cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. On the other side, two emerging VR applications—multisensory body illusions and the use of VR for the modification of attentional biases—even if supported by preliminary data still need further research.},

	abstract = {Some people report localised pain on their body when seeing other people in pain (sensory-localised vicarious pain responders). In this study, we assess whether this is related to atypical computations of body ownership which, in paradigms such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI), can be conceptualised as a Bayesian inference as to whether multiple sources of sensory information (visual, somatosensory) belong together on a single body (one’s own) or are distributed across several bodies (vision = other, somatosensory = self). According to this model, computations of body ownership depend on the degree (and precision) of sensory evidence, rather than synchrony per se. Sensory-localised vicarious pain responders exhibit the RHI following synchronous stroking and—unusually—also after asynchronous stroking. Importantly, this occurs only in asynchronous conditions in which the stroking is predictable (alternating) rather than unpredictable (random). There was no evidence that their bottom-up proprioceptive signals are less precise, suggesting individual differences in the top-down weighting of sensory evidence. Finally, the enfacement illusion (EI) was also employed as a conceptually related bodily illusion paradigm that involves a completely different response judgement (based on vision rather than proprioception). Sensory-localised responders show a comparable pattern on this task after synchronous and asynchronous stroking. This is consistent with the idea that they have top-down (prior) differences in the way body ownership is inferred that transcends the exact judgement being made (visual or proprioceptive).},

Methods: We used the moving rubber hand illusion in anatomic congruence with explicit measures to compare active asynchronous and passive synchronous movements in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia with first rank symptoms (FRS) (n = 31) versus without FRS (n = 25).
Results: Patients with FRS are characterized by a lack of agency in active asynchronous condition. The two groups had no sense of ownership in synchronous passive condition. Using a multivariate regression model, we found an association between agency and body ownership measures in the active asynchronous condition in two groups (OR: 1.825, p {\textless} 0.001). In the passive condition, this association was only present in the group with first rank symptoms (OR: 2.04, p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion: Temporal proximity and sensorimotor information are essential in the understanding of self-consciousness disorders in schizophrenia.},

As well as confirming previous results, here, we aimed at finding in the elderly an increased improvement after a longer virtual training with similar characteristics. Forty-two healthy older subjects (28 females, average age = 71.71 years) completed a parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT; UMIN000039843, umin.ac.jp) including an adapted version of the virtual training previously used: while sitting, participants observed the virtual body in a first-person perspective (1PP) or a third-person perspective (3PP) performing 20 min of virtual high-intensity intermittent exercise (vHIE; the avatar switched between fast and slow walking every 2 min). This was repeated twice a week for 6 weeks. During the vHIE, we measured the heart rate and administered questionnaires to evaluate illusory body ownership and agency. Before the beginning of the intervention, immediately after the first session of vHIE, and at the end of the entire intervention, we evaluated the cognitive performance at the Stroop task with online recording of the hemodynamic activity over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. While we confirm previous results regarding the virtual illusion and its physiological effects, we did not find significant cognitive or neural improvement immediately after the first vHIE session. As a novelty, in the 1PP group only, we detected a significant decrease in the response time of the Stroop task in the post-intervention assessment compared to its baseline; coherently, we found an increased activation on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) after the entire intervention. While the current results strengthen the impact of the virtual full-body illusion and its physiological consequences on the elderly as well, they might have stronger and more established body representations. Perhaps, a longer and increased exposure to those illusions is necessary to initiate the cascade of events that culminates to an improved cognitive performance.},

	abstract = {The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a phenomenon whereby participants recognize a fake hand as their own. Studies have examined the effects of observing fake hand movements after the RHI on brain sensorimotor ac­ tivity, although results remain controversial. To address these discrepancies, we investigated the effects of observation of fake hand rotation after the RHI on sensorimotor mu (μ: 8–13 Hz) and beta (β: 15–25 Hz) rhythm event-related desynchronization (ERD) using electroencephalography (EEG). Questionnaire results and propri­ oceptive drift revealed that the RHI occurred in participants when their invisible hand and fake visible hand were stroked synchronously but not during asynchronous stroking. Independent component (IC) clustering from EEG data during movement observation identified three IC clusters, including the right sensorimotor, left sensori­ motor, and left occipital cluster. In the right sensorimotor cluster, we observed distinct modulation of μ and β ERD during fake hand rotation. Illusory ownership over the fake hand enhanced μ ERD but inversely attenuated β ERD. Further, the extent of μ ERD correlated with proprioceptive drift, but not with questionnaire ratings, whereas the converse results were obtained for β ERD. No ownership-dependent ERD modulation was detected in the left sensorimotor cluster. Alpha (α: 8–13 Hz) rhythm ERD of the left occipital cluster was smaller in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition, but α ERD was not correlated with questionnaire rating or drift. These findings suggest that observing embodied fake hand rotation induces distinct cortical processing in sensorimotor brain areas.},

So far, the focus of RM has been the physical body. Neuroscience, however, is now suggesting that mental disorders can be broadly characterized by a dysfunction in the way the brain computes and integrates the representations of the inner and outer body across time [bodily self-consciousness (BSC)]. In this perspective, we proposed a new kind of clinical intervention, i.e., “Regenerative Virtual Therapy” (RVT), which integrates knowledge from different disciplines, from neuroscience to computational psychiatry, to regenerate a distorted or faulty BSC. The main goal of RVT was to use technology-based somatic modification techniques to restructure the maladaptive bodily representations behind a pathological condition. Specifically, starting from a Bayesian model of our BSC (i.e., body matrix), we suggested the use of mindful attention, cognitive reappraisal, and brain stimulation techniques merged with high-rewarding and novel synthetic multisensory bodily experience (i.e., a virtual reality full-body illusion in sync with a low predictabIlity interoceptive modulation) to rewrite a faulty experience of the body and to regenerate the wellbeing of an individual. The use of RVT will also offer an unprecedented experimental overview of the dynamics of our bodily representations, allowing the reverse-engineering of their functioning for hacking them using advanced technologies.},

We employed the rubber hand illusion to manipulate sense of body ownership in BPD. We extended previous research on illusory body ownership in BPD by testing: (i) two illusion conditions: asynchronous and synchronous stimulation, (ii) relationship between illusion experience and BPD symptoms, and (iii) relationship between illusion experience and maladaptive personality traits. We measured illusion strength (questionnaire responses), proprioceptive drift (perceived shift in physical hand position), BPD symptoms (Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines score), and maladaptive personality traits (Personality Inventory for DSM-5) in 24 BPD and 21 control participants. For subjective illusion strength, we found main effects of group (BPD {\textgreater} healthy control, F(1, 43) ¼ 11.94, P ¼ 0.001) and condition (synchronous {\textgreater} asynchronous, F(1, 43) ¼ 22.80, P {\textless} 0.001). There was a group Â condition interaction for proprioceptive drift (F(1, 43) ¼ 6.48, P ¼ 0.015) such that people with BPD maintained illusion susceptibility in the asynchronous condition. Borderline symptom severity correlated with illusion strength within the BPD group, and this effect was speciﬁc to affective (r ¼ 0.45, P {\textless} 0.01) and cognitive symptoms (r ¼ 0.46, P {\textless} 0.01). Across all participants, trait psychoticism correlated with illusion strength (r ¼ 0.44, P {\textless} 0.01). People with BPD are more susceptible to illusory body ownership than controls. This is consistent with the clinical literature describing aberrant physical and emotional experiences of self in BPD. A predictive coding framework holds promise to develop testable mechanistic hypotheses for disrupted bodily self in BPD.},

In this study we tested with virtual hand illusion, whether exclusivity (participant is certain who was controlling the virtual effector) can also be established. We manipulated two factors: exclusivity and consistency. Our results show that on both ownership and agency judgments, consistency and exclusivity produced main effects, and the two effects interacted in an underadditive fashion. Taken together, these findings provide support for our suggestion to extend Wegner’s agency theory to explain perceived body ownership, which in turn provides an integrative framework for interpreting constraints on ownership and agency illusions.},

Several RHI studies have reported that visual manipulation of the embodied fake hand inversely aﬀects the perceptual processing of the observer's own hand (e.g., thermal or pain sensitivity). In this study, we examined whether motor manipulation of the fake hand similarly aﬀects the observer's motor system. Our study employed a novel RHI paradigm wherein stroking was interrupted by unexpected movement of the fake hand (i.e., ﬁnger spreading) while measuring electroencephalography (EEG). We found that participants often spontaneously moved their hands in accordance with the movement of the fake hand only in the RHI (synchronous) sessions. EEG analyses revealed enhanced neural activation (mu-rhythm desynchronization) of the motor system during observation of the fake hand movement. Moreover, motor activation was greater in the synchronous than in the asynchronous condition and signiﬁcantly correlated with the feeling of body ownership over the fake hand. These ﬁndings provide strong behavioral and neurophysiological evidence of ‘motor back projection’, in which the movement of an illusory embodied body part is inversely transferred to the sensorimotor system of the observer.},

	abstract = {Previous evidence highlighted the multisensory-motor origin of embodiment – that is, the experience of having a body and of being in control of it – and the possibility of experimentally manipulating it. For instance, an illusory feeling of embodiment towards a fake hand can be triggered by providing synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation to the hand of participants and to a fake hand or by asking participants to move their hand and observe a fake hand moving accordingly (rubber hand illusion). Here, we tested whether it is possible to manipulate embodiment not through stimulation of the participant’s hand, but by directly tapping into the brain’s hand representation via non-invasive brain stimulation. To this aim, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to activate the hand corticospinal representation, with virtual reality (VR), to provide matching (as contrasted to non-matching) visual feedback, mimicking involuntary hand movements evoked by TMS. We show that the illusory embodiment occurred when TMS pulses were temporally matched with VR feedback, but not when TMS was administered outside primary motor cortex, (over the vertex) or when stimulating motor cortex at a lower intensity (that did not activate peripheral muscles). Behavioural (questionnaires) and neurophysiological (motor-evoked-potentials, TMS-evoked-movements) measures further indicated that embodiment was not explained by stimulation per se, but depended on the temporal coherence between TMS-induced activation of hand corticospinal representation and the virtual bodily feedback. This reveals that non-invasive brain stimulation may replace the application of external tactile hand cues and motor components related to volition, planning and anticipation.},

	abstract = {The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) paradigm has been widely used to investigate the sense of body ownership. People who report experiencing the pain of others are hypothesised to have diﬀerences in computing body ownership and, hence, we predicted that they would perform atypically on the RHI. The Vicarious Pain Questionnaire (VPQ), was used to divide participants into three groups: (1) non-responders (people who report no pain when seeing someone else experiencing physical pain), (2) sensory-localised responders (report sensory qualities and a localised feeling of pain) and (3) aﬀective-general responders (report a generalised and emotional feeling of pain). The sensory-localised group, showed susceptibility to the RHI (increased proprioceptive drift) irrespective of whether stimulation was synchronous or asynchronous, whereas the other groups only showed the RHI in the synchronous condition. This is not a general bias to always incorporate the dummy hand as we did not ﬁnd increased susceptibility in other conditions (seeing touch without feeling touch, or feeling touch without seeing touch), but there was a trend for this group to incorporate the dummy hand when it was stroked with a laser light. Although individual diﬀerences in the RHI have been noted previously, this particular pattern is rare. It suggests a greater malleability (i.e. insensitivity to asynchrony) in the conditions in which other bodies inﬂuence own-body judgments.},

Our results showed that proprioceptive shift was positively correlated with the attenuation of auditory outcomes. No signiﬁcant correlations were found between the explicit measures of the two senses.

By using many different experimental paradigms, both experiences have been extensively studied over the last years. This review introduces both concepts, with a special focus also onto their interplay.

The MPT was recorded on the left hand of the subjects before and after induction of the RHI, as well as during the phase in which the model hand was pricked with a sharp knife or touched by the blunt knife handle. The results indicate that the RHI could be successfully generated with our set-up. Mechanical stimuli were perceived as more painful in the condition where the rubber hand was simultaneously pricked with a knife.

Until recently, most studies of multisensory integration and body ownership concerned only vision, touch and proprioception; the role of other modalities, such as the vestibular system and interoception, has been neglected and remains poorly understood. In particular, no study to date has directly explored the combined eﬀect of vestibular and interoceptive signals on body ownership. Here, we investigated for the ﬁrst time how Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (left, right, sham), tactile aﬀectivity (a reclassiﬁed interoceptive modality manipulated by applying touch at C-tactile optimal versus non-optimal velocities), and their combination, inﬂuence proprioceptive and subjective measures of body ownership during a rubber hand illusion paradigm with healthy participants (N = 26). Our results show that vestibular stimulation (left GVS) signiﬁcantly increased proprioceptive drift towards the rubber hand during mere visual exposure to the rubber hand. Moreover, it also enhanced participants’ proprioceptive drift towards the rubber hand during manipulations of synchronicity and aﬀective touch. These ﬁndings suggest that the vestibular system inﬂuences multisensory integration, possibly by re-weighting both the two-way relationship between proprioception and vision, as well as the three-way relationship between proprioception, vision and aﬀective touch. We discuss these ﬁndings in relation to current predictive coding models of multisensory integration and body ownership.},

	abstract = {Body ownership (the feeling that my body belongs to me) can be easily perturbed in healthy individuals by inducing bodily illusions. For example, dis-integrating vision, touch, and proprioception can produce the feeling that your limb is ‘lost’, such as in “the disappearing hand trick” (DHT). Following this illusion, participants report that the hand feels as though it is no longer part of the body, that it does not belong to them anymore, and that they do not know its location. However, it remains unknown whether this illusion can also be applied to the feet. Lower body ownership is disturbed in some populations, such as in Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID), where people have a longstanding desire to paralyze or amputate a (disowned) part of their body (i.e. usually the legs), thus exploring the eﬃcacy and utility of lower body illusions might be useful for populations like such. In the current study, we induced the disappearing hand and foot trick in two groups of healthy adults. As the illusion crucially relies on illusory sensory feedback, we also explored if one's level of sensory suggestibility inﬂuenced the experience of the illusion. Questionnaire data showed that the DHT can be applied to the feet, as there was no diﬀerence in experience between those who experienced the illusion for the hands and those who experienced the illusion for the feet. Moreover, one's level of sensory suggestibility correlated positively with the experience of illusory sensations (like warmth, numbness, or the presence of an extra limb) following the illusion. We discuss the implications of bodily illusions in clinical populations and emphasize the critical role that sensory signals (even illusory) play in creating the bodily experience.},

Positive dynamics of ownership were found in the RHI but not in the VHI. The general dynamics of proprioceptive drift were similar in both illusions: during the onset phase of artiﬁcial hand representation proprioceptive drift gradually increased, and during the fading phase – it gradually decreased. Kinematic analysis of the VHI revealed several motion features (such as jerk, smoothness, velocity), predicted illusion measures, and probably reﬂected that participants with higher motor abilities and better adaptation to new sensory conditions may have better multisensory integration mechanisms that are responsible for the ownership illusion.},

Usually, it is explored by means of the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) during which a dummy hand is incorporated in the mental representation of one's own body throughout a multisensory (visuo-tactile) integration mechanism. Particular attention has been paid to the neurofunctional counterparts of this mechanism highlighting the pivotal role of an occipito-parieto-frontal network involving the Ventral Premotor area (PMv). To date, the speciﬁc role of the PMv in generating the sense of ownership is still unknown. In this study, we aimed at exploring the role of PMv in generating and experiencing the RHI. Oﬀ-line repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) was applied to a group of 24 healthy participants whilst changes in proprioceptive judgment and self-reported illusion sensations were collected and analysed separately. The PMv was not directly implicated in generating the sense of ownership. Indeed, its inhibition aﬀected the explicit detection of the visuo-tactile congruence without interfering with the illusion experience itself. We hypothesized that the conscious visuo-tactile congruence detection may be independent from the conscious illusion experience. Also, our results support the view that the RHI grounds on a complex interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes, as the visuo-tactile integration per se may be not suﬃcient to trigger the subjective illusion.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia has been described as a psychiatric condition characterized by deﬁcits in one's own and others' face recognition, as well as by a disturbed sense of body-ownership. To date, no study has integrated these two lines of research with the aim of investigating Enfacement Illusion (EI) proneness in schizophrenia. To accomplish this goal, the classic EI protocol was adapted to test the potential plasticity of both Self-Other and OtherOther boundaries. Results showed that EI induced the expected malleability of Self-Other boundary among both controls and patients. Interestingly, for the ﬁrst time, the present study demonstrates that also the OtherOther boundary was inﬂuenced by EI. Furthermore, comparing the two groups, the malleability of the OtherOther boundary showed an opposite modulation. These results suggest that, instead of greater Self-Other boundary plasticity, a qualitative difference can be detected between schizophrenia patients and controls in the malleability of the Other-Other boundary. The present study points out a totally new aspect about body-illusions and schizophrenia disorder, demonstrating that EI is not only conﬁned to self-sphere but it also affects the way we discriminate others, representing a potential crucial aspect in the social domain.},

To answer this question, here we examined if a prolonged increase of the amount of movements affects body ownership. Specifically, we administered the rubber hand illusion paradigm within a natural condition of long-term motor practice, namely in expert pianists. We compared the illusory effects of both static (visuotactile stimulation) and dynamic (active/passive movements) versions of that paradigm in a group of expert pianists and a group of non-musicians. The illusion was measured behaviorally (proprioceptive drift) and subjectively (questionnaire). Our results showed that pianists were significantly less susceptible to any type of the illusion, compared to the non-musicians. Moreover, they did not experience the illusion in general (presenting neither the proprioceptive drift, nor the subjective feeling of ownership). These findings suggest that the increased amount of motor-related afferent and efferent signals does affect the construction and the coherence of body ownership, thus showing the role of movements in this process.},

	abstract = {The rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm experimentally produces an illusion of rubber hand ownership and arm shift by simultaneously stroking a rubber hand in view and a participant’s visually occluded hand. It involves visual, tactile, and proprioceptive multisensory integration and activates multisensory areas in the brain, including the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Multisensory inputs are transformed into outputs for motor control in association areas such as PPC. A behavioral study reported decreased motor performance after RHI. However, it remains unclear whether RHI modifies the interactions between sensory and motor systems and between PPC and the primary motor cortex (M1). We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and examined the functional connections from the primary somatosensory and association cortices to M1 and from PPC to M1 during RHI. In experiment 1, short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-latency afferent inhibition (LAI) were measured before and immediately after a synchronous (RHI) or an asynchronous (control) condition. In experiment 2, PPC-M1 interaction was measured using two coils. We found that SAI and LAI were reduced in the synchronous condition compared with baseline, suggesting that RHI decreased somatosensory processing in the primary sensory and the association cortices projecting to M1. We also found that greater inhibitory PPC-M1 interaction was associated with stronger RHI assessed by questionnaire. Our findings suggest that RHI modulates both the early and late stages of processing of tactile afferent, which leads to altered M1 excitability by reducing the gain of somatosensory afferents to resolve conflicts among multisensory inputs.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Perception of one’s own body parts involves integrating different sensory information and is important for motor control. We found decreased effects of cutaneous stimulation on motor cortical excitability during rubber hand illusion (RHI), which may reflect decreased gain of tactile input to resolve multisensory conflicts. RHI strength correlated with the degree of inhibitory posterior parietal cortex-motor cortex interaction, indicating that parietal-motor connection is involved in resolving sensory conflicts and body ownership during RHI.},

	abstract = {A strong male prevalence has been observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) since its deﬁnition, but the behavioral manifestations of sex disparity have yet to be clariﬁed. Here, we investigate sex differences in the perception of the Numbness Illusion (NI), a procedure based on a tactile conﬂict, in adults with ASD and with typical development. We aim to assess if women and men with ASD perceive NI-dependent body ownership differently and whether sex differences emerge in individuals with typical development. To elicit the NI, participants pressed their right-hand palm against the confederate’s hand and stroked with the thumb and the index ﬁnger of their left hand the joined index ﬁngers in a synchronous or asynchronous way. Results reveal that women with ASD present a reversed and atypical pattern for the NI compared to men with ASD and a group of matched controls. In particular, women with ASD report a stronger illusion than men with ASD, that is more evident in the asynchronous conditions. In the asynchronous condition, women in the ASD group report stronger NI as compared to women and men in the Control group, whereas men with ASD only to men in the Control group. In the typical sample, the NI emerges only in the synchronous condition and no sex difference is observed. We discuss our results in terms of potential advantage of women in sociality and sensory information processing that might lead women with ASD to use different modalities to solve the illusion compared to men with ASD. In sum, these outcomes describe sex differences in individuals with ASD in the domain of illusory perception. This may be used in the future to support the characterization of the female phenotype of autism.},

	abstract = {Can the mere expectation of a sensory event being about to occur on an artificial limb be sufficient to elicit an illusory sense of ownership over said limb? This issue is currently under debate and studies using two different paradigms have presented conflicting results. Here, we employed the two relevant paradigms, namely, the magnetic touch illusion and the “tactile expectation” version of the rubber hand illusion, to clarify the role of tactile expectations in the process of attributing ownership to limbs. The illusory senses of ownership and ‘magnetic touch’ were quantified using questionnaires, threat-evoked skin conductance responses and a combination of motion tracking synchronized with real-time subjective ratings and skin conductance. The results showed that the magnetic touch illusion was dependent on concurrent visual and tactile stimulation and that visually induced tactile expectations alone were insufficient. Moreover, in this study, tactile expectations were not associated with the rubber hand illusion, neither in terms of subjective ratings nor skin conductance changes. Together, these findings contradict the notion that the brain uses predictions of upcoming sensory events to determine whether or not a limb belongs to the self, and, instead, emphasize the importance of correlated multisensory information.},

	abstract = {The feeling of owning a body part is often investigated by conducting and manipulating the rubber hand illusion, a three-way integration of vision, touch, and proprioception. In the last decade, more research on the role of interoception, the sense of the body's’ internal state, in the illusion has been made. One of the studied factors has been the affective touch, a caress-like, gentle, touch that is performed at a slow specific speed (1-10 cm/sec). Affective touch activates the C tactile afferents which send interoceptive signals to the brain, specifically the insula. The present systematic review investigated the role affective touch has on the strength of the rubber hand illusion. A range of electronic databases was searched for papers reporting research findings published in English before March 20, 2020. Twelve different articles were identified, but only five papers met the inclusion criteria. This thesis looked at the results from these five different studies and compared the effect of affective touch and discriminative, regular, touch have on the rubber hand illusion to see whether there is a significant difference. The results could not show a main effect of stroking velocity, site of stimulation, or social touch, which are components of affective touch. The results was based on four different measurements, the subjective experience of the illusion, pleasantness ratings, proprioceptive drift, and temperature difference in the skin. Opposed what was hypothesized, it could not be demonstrated that affective touch would induce a stronger rubber hand illusion than discriminative touch.},

	abstract = {Adaptive behavior usually requires accurate representations of body positions and ownership, which rely on integration of multiple sources of sensory information. The rubber hand illusion (RHI) presents a compelling example demonstrating that the combination of visual and tactile signals strongly inﬂuences the subjective experience of body ownership. However, it still remains unclear how the perception of body ownership in turn alters other aspects of sensory processing, such as pain perception. In the present study, we examined whether the RHI could modulate the subjective experience of pain. We set three conditions corresponding to different levels of ownership of the rubber hand: the synchronous condition in which the rubber and the real hand were simultaneously stroked; the asynchronous condition in which the two hands were asynchronously stroked; the own-hand-only condition in which only the real hand was stroked. Results from the screening experiment indicated that subjects experienced the stronger RHI in the synchronous condition, compared with the strength of RHI in the other two conditions. In the main experiment, subjects were requested to report the intensity and unpleasantness of pain evoked by laser stimuli under the three stroking conditions. Results showed that pain ratings were signiﬁcantly lower under the synchronous condition than those under the other two conditions, suggesting the RHI could induce a signiﬁcant analgesic effect. Furthermore, the correlation analysis showed that the degree of the analgesic effect was positively correlated with the RHI strength across individuals. Taken together, these results suggest an analgesic effect of the RHI and support the potential usage of visual illusions in future translational research on pain.},

	abstract = {During childhood, children’s bodies undergo rapid physical growth, which may affect their ability to accurately perceive their own bodies as well as the external environment. Concurrently, multisensory processes underlying bodily self-consciousness gradually develop. However, little is known of the relation between changes in body size and corresponding update in bodily selfconsciousness. In this study, 6- to 8-year-old children experienced the ‘‘rubber hand illusion” while watching a regular (child-like) or larger (adult-like) rubber hand being touched either synchronously or asynchronously with their own real hand. We measured proprioceptive drift and subjective ownership as well as changes in weight estimation of objects. Synchronous versus asynchronous visuotactile stroking with both the regular and larger hands caused a change in subjective body ownership but did not make a difference in perceived hand location and weight estimation of objects having the same size but different weight. Intriguingly, simply viewing the regular hand led to greater proprioceptive drift and to overestimation of the objects’ weight relative to the larger hand. In addition, weight estimation was also inﬂuenced by hand size after visuotactile stroking. These results demonstrate that visuotactile information modulates the intrinsic properties of body representation in terms of size in children and further corroborate previous ﬁndings suggesting late developing optimal calibration of visual and proprioceptive signals.},

Fifty non-clinical participants were randomly assigned to synchronous or asynchronous visuo-tactile groups. During the pre-assessment, all participants filled in BIDs and body-anxiety questionnaires. Then, they were embodied into two virtual bodies (VBs): firstly, with their real measurements, and secondly, with a larger-size body. Body image disturbances, body anxiety, fear of gaining weight, and FBI levels were assessed after exposure to each avatar. All participants in both conditions showed higher levels of BIDs and body anxiety after owning the larger-size VB than after owning the real-size VB (p {\textless} 0.05). The synchronous visuo-tactile group had higher scores, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. This study provides evidence of the usefulness of this new embodiment-based technique to induce changes in BIDs or body anxiety in a non-clinical sample, being suitable for use in future body image interventions.},

The illusion of having a tall body signiﬁcantly reduced the IPS and enlarged PPS. On the other hand, the illusion of having a short body contracted the IPS, leaving the PPS intact. A further experiment (Experiment 3), showed that the illusory ownership for the tall or short body is a necessary condition to update the participants’ height representation. Thus, a change in body height representation was eﬀective to reveal a dissociation in the representation of the space around the body, depending on whether this sector of space is used for programming actions, or for regulating social interactions.},

Methods. Fifteen participants with obesity and ﬁfteen healthy-weight participants took part at this study in which the VR-Full-Body Illusion was adopted. The strength of illusion was investigated through the traditional Embodiment Questionnaire, while changes in bodily experience were measured through a body size estimation task. Results. Participants with obesity as well as healthy-weight participants reported to experience the illusion. About the body size estimation task, both groups reported changes only in the estimation of the abdomen’s circumference after the experimental condition, in absence of any another diﬀerence. Discussion. Participants with obesity reported to experience the illusion over a skinny avatar, but the modulation of the bodily experience seems controversial. Future lines of research exploiting this technique for modulating body representations in obesity, speciﬁcally in terms of potential therapeutic use, were discussed.},

The relationship between body-ownership and the sense of agency has been described by different neurocognitive models, each providing speciﬁc neurofunctional predictions. According to an “additive” model, the sense of agency entails body-ownership, while an alternative “independence” hypothesis suggests that they represent two qualitatively different processes, underpinned by distinct brain systems. We propose a third “interactive” model, arguing the interdependence between body-ownership and the sense of agency: these constructs might represent different experiences with speciﬁc and exclusive brain correlates, but they also could partly overlap at the neurofunctional level. Here we test these three neurocognitive models by reviewing the available neurofunctional literature of body-ownership and the sense of agency, with a quantitative meta-analytical approach that allowed us to compare their neural correlates statistically. We identiﬁed (i) a body-ownership-speciﬁc network including the left inferior parietal lobule and the left extra-striate body area, (ii) a sense-of-agency-speciﬁc network including the left SMA, the left posterior insula, the right postcentral gyrus, and the right superior temporal lobe and (iii) a shared network in the left middle insula.},

We recently found that the observation of embodied fake hand movement elicited mu-rhythm (8–13 Hz) desynchronization on electroencephalography (EEG), suggesting brain activation in the sensorimotor regions. However, it is known that mu-rhythm desynchronization during action observation is confounded with occipital alpha-rhythm desynchronization, which is modulated by attention. This study examined the independence of brain activities in the sensorimotor and occipital regions relating to the movement observation under the RHI. The invisible participant’s left and fake right hands were stroked simultaneously, which was interrupted by unexpected fake hand movements. A mirror-reversed image of the fake hand was shown on a monitor in front of the participant with a delay of 80, 280, or 480 ms. Illusion strength decreased as a function of the delay. EEG independent component analysis (ICA) and ICA clustering revealed six clusters with observation-induced desynchronization of 8–13 Hz frequency band. In the right sensorimotor cluster, mu-rhythm desynchronization was the greatest under the 80-ms delay, while alpha-rhythm desynchronization of the occipital clusters did not show delay-dependence. These results suggest that brain activation in the sensorimotor areas (i.e., mu-rhythm desynchronization) induced by embodied fake hand movement is independent of that in the occipital areas (alpha-rhythm desynchronization).},

Combining physiological recordings with immersive virtual reality, we found that an ecological mapping of real respiratory patterns onto a virtual body illusorily changes corporeal awareness. This new way of inducing a respiratory bodily illusion, called “embreathment,” revealed that breathing is almost as important as visual appearance for inducing body ownership and more important than any other cue for body agency. These effects were moderated by individual levels of interoception, as assessed through a standard heartbeat-counting task and a new “pneumoception” task. By showing that respiratory, visual, and spatial signals exert a specific and weighted influence on the fundamental feeling that one is an embodied agent, we pave the way for a comprehensive hierarchical model of corporeal awareness.

	abstract = {Body ownership relies on spatiotemporal correlations between multisensory signals and visual cues specifying oneself such as body form and orientation. The mechanism for the integration of bodily signals remains unclear. One approach to model multisensory integration that has been influential in the multisensory literature is Bayesian causal inference. This specifies that the brain integrates spatial and temporal signals coming from different modalities when it infers a common cause for inputs. As an example, the rubber hand illusion shows that visual form and orientation cues can promote the inference of a common cause (one’s body) leading to spatial integration shown by a proprioceptive drift of the perceived location of the real hand towards the rubber hand. Recent studies investigating the effect of visual cues on temporal integration, however, have led to conflicting findings. These could be due to task differences, variation in ecological validity of stimuli and/or small samples. In this pre-registered study, we investigated the influence of visual information on temporal integration using a visuo-tactile temporal order judgement task with realistic stimuli and a sufficiently large sample determined by Bayesian analysis. Participants viewed videos of a touch being applied to plausible or implausible visual stimuli for one’s hand (hand oriented plausibly, hand rotated 180 degrees, or a sponge) while also being touched at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. Participants judged which stimulus came first: viewed or felt touch. Results show that visual cues do not modulate visuo-tactile temporal order judgements. This is not in line with the idea that bodily signals indicating oneself influence the integration of multisensory signals in the temporal domain. The current study emphasises the importance of rigour in our methodologies and analyses to advance the understanding of how properties of multisensory events affect the encoding of temporal information in the brain.},

            Evidence suggests that the sense of the position of our body parts can be surreptitiously deceived, for instance through illusory visual inputs. However, whether altered visual feedback during limb movement can induce substantial unconscious motor and muscular adjustments is not known. To address this question, we covertly manipulated virtual body movements in immersive virtual reality. Participants were instructed to flex their elbow to 90° while tensing an elastic band, as their virtual arm reproduced the same, a reduced (75°), or an amplified (105°) movement. We recorded muscle activity using electromyography, and assessed body ownership, agency and proprioception of the arm. Our results not only show that participants compensated for the avatar’s manipulated arm movement while being completely unaware of it, but also that it is possible to induce unconscious motor adaptations requiring significant changes in muscular activity. Altered visual feedback through body ownership illusions can influence motor performance in a process that bypasses awareness.},

However, it was unknown if the RFI could be elicited by synchronous movement of a participant’s foot and a model foot. To examine this, we developed the Moving Rubber Foot Illusion (mRFI) and compared participants’ experience of it to the RFI. The results of this study suggests that the RFI can be elicited through synchronous movement, and results in more proprioceptive drift than a static variant of the RFI.

	abstract = {The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a perceptual illusion in which one is made to feel that a hand-shaped object is part of their body. This illusion is believed to be the result of the integration of afferent information. However, there has been an increasing amount of evidence that suggests efferent information plays a role in this illusion as well. Previous research has found that individuals who are afflicted by pathological lack of movement experience the RHI more vividly than control participants. Whereas individuals who move their hands more than the general population (i.e. professional pianists) experience the RHI less vividly than control participants. Based upon the available evidence it would seem that muscle activity prior to experiencing the RHI should be associated with how vividly one experiences different indices of the illusion. In the present study we tested this possibility by having participants perform a maximum voluntary muscle contraction task prior to experiencing three variants of the RHI (moving active, moving passive and classic). It was found that electromyographic features known to be indicative of muscle fatigue exhibited a positive association with proprioceptive drift when stimulation was synchronous or visual movement only (with the exception of the passive moving RHI synchronous condition). More work is needed to better characterize the muscular processes associated with experiencing the RHI.},

Twelve right-handed healthy adults participated in this study. All participants randomly performed both the illusion and observation conditions in 20 min, respectively. Illusion condition was induced kinesthetic illusion by viewing own finger movement video. Observation condition was observed own finger movement video. Before and after each condition, the brain activity of kinesthetic motor imagery was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The measure of brain activity under kinesthetic motor imagery was executed in five sets using block design. Under the kinesthetic motor imagery, participants were asked to imagine the movement of their right finger. Functional connectivity was analyzed during the kinesthetic motor imagery. In addition, after performing the task under kinesthetic motor imagery, the vividness of the kinesthetic motor imagery was measured using a visual analog scale. Furthermore, after each condition, the degree of kinesthetic illusion and sense of body ownership measured based on a sevenpoint Likert scale. Our results indicated that the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery was changed in the frontal-parietal network of the right hemisphere. The vividness of the kinesthetic motor imagery was significantly higher with the illusion condition compared with the observation condition. The degree of kinesthetic illusion and sense of body ownership were significantly higher with the illusion condition compared with the observation condition. In conclusion, the visual-motor illusion changes the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery and influences the vividness of kinesthetic motor imagery. The visual-motor illusion provides evidence that it improves motor imagery ability. VMI may be used in patients with impaired motor imagery.},

Empirical investigations of SoO have mostly focused on the manipulation of self-ascription of sensations and experiences involving the body via the induction of bodily illusions, such as the Rubber-Hand Illusion (RHI). While it has been proposed that the affective dimension necessarily contributes to the development of a full ownership ascription, the relationship between affective experience and body ownership still presents many open questions. This study thus aimed at investigating the boundaries of ownership ascriptions and the extent to which an external object can be incorporated within one’s own body representation, with a speciﬁc focus on the possibility for it to become a potential object of own affective experience marked by speciﬁc electrophysiological responses. Therefore, we induced RHI in 16 participants and then applied an aversive vs. pleasant stimulation to the embodied external object, while monitoring their electrophysiological activity for central physiological markers of affective processing. Data analysis revealed the effect of the stimulation condition on alpha band power over frontal areas, with higher alpha power during the pleasant stimulation condition with respect to the aversive stimulation one over medial and right frontal electrode sites. The present ﬁndings add to the limited pieces of evidence concerning the link between experiences of illusory body ownership, embodiment mechanisms, and affective factors, suggesting that the boundaries of body ownership might be extended to making incorporated objects the source of complex emotional responses beyond basic defensive reactions.},

A group of patients with left-hemisphere damage (N = 12) and chronic motor deficits completed an immersive virtual reality training (three sessions of 15 min each week for 11 weeks). Patients sat still and either experienced (first-person perspective) or did not experience (third-person perspective) illusory ownership over the body of a standing virtual avatar. After the training, in which the avatar walked around a virtual environment, only patients who experienced the illusion improved gait and balance. We argue that representing the virtual body as their own allowed patients to access motor functioning and promoted motor recovery. This procedure might be integrated with rehabilitative approaches centered on motor execution. These findings also have an impact on the knowledge of the motor system in general.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the neuronal correlates of touch under different degrees of body ownership. Participants’ left and right arms were stimulated either alone or together with a fake counterpart while this stimulation was synchronous, ambiguous or asynchronous. Synchronous stimulation induced illusory fake arm ownership, but the brain still differentiated between touch to one’s real arm and to an illusory ‘owned’ arm: the degree of arm ownership was encoded positively by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lateral occipitotemporal cortex and negatively in the temporoparietal cortex. Conversely, the ventral premotor cortex responded more strongly to synchronous stimulation compared with asynchronous stimulation and with real arm only stimulation. These results offer new insights into the differential representation of the real body vs a body that is temporarily self-attributed following the resolution of multisensory conﬂict.},

Most previous studies investigating the RHI have involved young healthy adults within a very narrow age range (typically 20–30 years old). The purpose of this paper was to determine the inﬂuence of age on the RHI. The RHI was performed on 93 healthy adults classiﬁed into three groups of age (20–35 years old, N = 41; 36–60 years old, N = 28; and 61–80 years old, N = 24), and its eﬀects were measured with subjective (Embodiment of Rubber Hand Questionnaire), behavioral (proprioceptive drift), and physiological (changes in skin temperature and conductance) measures. There were neither signiﬁcant diﬀerences among groups in any response, nor signiﬁcant covariability or correlation between age and other measures (but for skin temperature), which suggests that the RHI elicits similar responses across diﬀerent age groups in the adult phase.},

We tested a group of healthy participants, whose left-hand movements were prevented by a cast for one week, and a control group without any movement restriction. In both groups, we measured the strength of the rubber hand illusion (i.e., proprioceptive shift and questionnaire on ownership) and the physiological parameters known to be modulated by short-term arm immobilization (i.e., resting motor threshold, motor evoked potentials and force parameters) before and after the week of immobilization. Our results showed stronger illusory eﬀects on the immobilized hand on both behavioral indexes and weaker illusory eﬀects on the non-immobilized hand on the questionnaire. Additionally, the increased proprioceptive shift was positively correlated to the motor threshold of the contralateral hemisphere. Our ﬁndings show at both behavioral and physiological level that altering those movement-related signals which constantly stem from our own body parts, modulates the experience of those body parts as mine. This, in turn, supports the view of a direct role of actions in the developing and maintaining a coherent body ownership.},

Participants experience a sense of ownership over an artiﬁcial hand when their hidden real hand and the visible artiﬁcial hand are synchronously stroked. Using lesion masks and behavioral data from a previous study on RHI failure in acute stroke patients, we here employed lesion network-symptom-mapping (LNSM) based on normative functional connectome data to identify lesion-dependent network connectivity related to the experience of selfattribution of an artiﬁcial hand in the RHI paradigm. We found that failure to experience the RHI was associated with higher normative lesion-dependent network connectivity to the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), right anterior Insula (raI) and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Since these areas were spared by the infarction in most patients with RHI failure (89\% for rTPJ and 94\% for raI/rIFG), the analysis suggests that remote dysfunction in rTPJ, raI, and rIFG accounted for RHI failure. These results highlight the potential role of rTPJ, raI, and rIFG in bodily self-consciousness. LNSM is a powerful tool capable of delineating the architecture of functional networks underlying complex cognitive function.},

Given that this kind of effect can be taken to reflect self–other integration (i.e., the integration of some external, novel event into the representation of oneself), and given that self–other integration has been previously shown to be affected by metacontrol states (biases of information processing towards persistence/selectivity or flexibility/integration), we tested whether the VHI varies in size depending on the metacontrol bias. Persistence and flexibility biases were induced by having participants carry out a convergent thinking (Remote Associates) task or divergent-thinking (Alternate Uses) task, respectively, while experiencing a virtual hand moving synchronously or asynchronously with their real hand. Synchrony-induced agency and ownership effects were more pronounced in the context of divergent thinking than in the context of convergent thinking, suggesting that a metacontrol bias towards flexibility promotes self–other integration.},

	abstract = {From a neuroscientiﬁc perspective, the sensations induced by acupuncture are not only the product of the bottom-up modulation of simple needling at somatosensory receptors, but also of the reciprocal interaction of top-down modulation from the brain. The present study investigated whether acupuncture stimulation to incorporated body parts produces brain responses that are similar to the responses observed following acupuncture stimulation to the real hand. The present study included 17 participants who watched a rubber hand being synchronously stroked with their unseen left hand to induce incorporation of the rubber hand into their body. After the experimental modiﬁcation of body ownership, acupuncture needle stimulation was applied to the LI4 acupoint on the incorporated rubber hand while brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). When the rubber hand was fully incorporated with the real body, acupuncture stimulation to the rubber hand resulted in the experience of the DeQi sensation as well as brain activations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and medial temporal (MT) visual area. The insular activation was associated with the DeQi sensation from the rubber hand. The psychophysical and neurophysiological responses associated with acupuncture stimulation to the incorporated rubber hand were inﬂuenced by an enhanced bodily awareness of the hand, which was likely due to top-down modulation from the interoceptive system in the brain.},

	abstract = {Bodily self-consciousness refers to bodily processes operating at personal, peripersonal, and extrapersonal spatial dimensions. Although the neural underpinnings of representations of personal and peripersonal space associated with bodily self-consciousness were thoroughly investigated, relatively few is known about the neural underpinnings of representations of extrapersonal space relevant for bodily selfconsciousness. In the search to unravel brain structures generating a representation of the extrapersonal space relevant for bodily self-consciousness, we developed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate the implication of the superior colliculus (SC) in bodily illusions, and more speciﬁcally in the rubber hand illusion (RHi), which constitutes an established paradigm to study the neural underpinnings of bodily self-consciousness. We observed activation of the colliculus ipsilateral to the manipulated hand associated with eliciting of RHi. A generalized form of context-dependent psychophysiological interaction analysis unravelled increased illusion-dependent functional connectivity between the SC and some of the main brain areas previously involved in bodily self-consciousness: right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), bilateral ventral premotor cortex (vPM), and bilateral postcentral gyrus. We hypothesize that the collicular map of the extrapersonal space interacts with maps of the peripersonal and personal space generated at rTPJ, vPM and the postcentral gyrus, producing a uniﬁed representation of space that is relevant for bodily self-consciousness. We suggest that processes of multisensory integration of bodily-related sensory inputs located in this uniﬁed representation of space constitute one main factor underpinning emergence of bodily self-consciousness.

The present study aimed to investigate how modifications of body ownership using the RHI affect local blood flow and cerebral responses during acupuncture needle stimulation. During the RHI, acupuncture needle stimulation was applied to the real left hand while measuring blood microcirculation with a LASER Doppler imager (Experiment 1, N = 28) and concurrent brain signal changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; Experiment 2, N = 17). When the body ownership of participants was altered by the RHI, acupuncture stimulation resulted in a significantly lower increase in local blood flow (Experiment 1), and significantly less brain activation was detected in the right insula (Experiment 2). This study found changes in both local blood flow and brain responses during acupuncture needle stimulation following modification of body ownership. These findings suggest that physiological responses during acupuncture stimulation can be influenced by the modification of body ownership.},

Behavioral links between body ownership and vicariousness have been shown, but the neural underpinnings remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigated the neural effects of altered body ownership on vicarious somatosensation. While recording functional brain imaging data, first, we altered participants’ body ownership by robotically delivering tactile stimulations (“tactile” stroking) in synchrony or not with videos of a virtual hand being brushed (“visual” stroking). Then, we manipulated vicarious somatosensation by showing videos of the virtual hand being touched by a syringe’s plunger (touch) or needle (pain). Only after the alteration of body ownership (synchronous visuo-tactile stroking) and specifically during late epochs of vicarious somatosensation, vicarious pain was associated with lower activation in premotor and anterior cingulate cortices with respect to vicarious touch. At the methodological level, the present study highlights the importance of the neural response’s temporal evolution. At the theoretical level, it shows that the higher-level (cognitive) impact of a lower-level (sensory) body-related processing (visuo-tactile) is not limited to body ownership but also extends to other psychological body-related domains, such as vicarious somatosensation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Diﬀerentiation between self-produced tactile stimuli and touch by others is necessary for social interactions and for a coherent concept of “self”. In attention-deﬁcit-hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD), tactile hypersensitivity and social cognition problems are part of the symptomatology, but pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Diﬀerentiation of self- and non-self- generated sensations might be key to understand and develop novel strategies for managing hypersensitivity. Here, we compared the neural signatures of aﬀective self- and other-touch between adults with ADHD and neurotypical controls (NC).
Methods: Twenty-eight adult ADHD participants and 30 age- and gender-matched NC performed a self-othertouch-task during functional magnetic resonance imaging: they stroked their own arm, an object, or were stroked by the experimenter. In addition, tactile detection thresholds and rubber hand illusion (RHI) were measured.
Results: ADHD participants had more autistic traits than NC and reported to engage less in interpersonal touch. They also reported to be more sensitive to tactile stimuli. Compared to NC, ADHD participants showed enhanced responses to both the self- and other-touch conditions: stronger deactivation during self-touch in the anterior and posterior insula, and increased activation during other-touch in primary somatosensory cortex. ADHD participants had intact tactile detection thresholds, but were less susceptible to the RHI.
Conclusions: Unaltered detection thresholds suggest that peripheral processing is intact, and that hypersensitivity might be driven by central mechanisms. This has clinical implications for managing somatosensory hypersensitivity in ADHD. The more pronounced diﬀerentiation between self- and other-touch might indicate a clearer self-other-distinction. This is of interest regarding body ownership perception in both NC and ADHD, and possibly other psychiatric conditions with altered self-experiences, like schizophrenia. A sharper boundary of the own body might relate to deﬁcits in social cognition and tactile hypersensitivity.},

	abstract = {Social aggression, such as domestic violence, has been associated with a reduced ability to take on others’ perspectives. In this naturalistic imaging study, we investigated whether training human participants to take on a firstperson embodied perspective during the experience of domestic violence enhances the identification with the victim and elicits brain activity associated with the monitoring of the body and surrounding space and the experience of threat. We combined fMRI measurements with preceding virtual reality exposure from either first-person perspective (1PP) or third-person perspective (3PP) to manipulate whether the domestic abuse stimulus was perceived as directed to oneself or another. We found that 1PP exposure increased body ownership and identification with the virtual victim. Furthermore, when the stimulus was perceived as directed toward oneself, the brain network that encodes the bodily self and its surrounding space was more strongly synchronized across participants and connectivity increased from premotor cortex (PM) and intraparietal sulcus towards superior parietal lobe. Additionally, when the stimulus came near the body, brain activity in the amygdala (AMG) strongly synchronized across participants. Exposure to 3PP reduced synchronization of brain activity in the personal space network, increased modulation of visual areas and strengthened functional connectivity between PM, supramarginal gyrus and primary visual cortex. In conclusion, our results suggest that 1PP embodiment training enhances experience from the viewpoint of the virtual victim, which is accompanied by synchronization in the fronto-parietal network to predict actions toward the body and in the AMG to signal the proximity of the stimulus.},

	abstract = {Human vision is an active process that involves shifting attention across the visual scene, with or without moving the eyes. Such shifts of attention can be generated at will (endogenously) or be triggered automatically, i.e., generated in response to exogenous stimuli including socially relevant cues such as someone else’s gaze. What are the common and distinct brain mechanisms involved in these processes? To address this question, we carried out a quantitative effect-location meta-analysis of 59 brain-imaging experiments whose results were published using standardized coordinates. For each condition of interest, namely voluntary and visually triggered eye movements, voluntary and visually triggered (covert) shifts of attention, and perception of someone else’s gaze, we computed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) maps. Those maps represent at each voxel of the brain the probability of reporting a signal change related to the condition of interest. For eye movements, this analysis conﬁrmed the spatial location of the frontal eye ﬁelds, supplementary eye ﬁelds, and parietal saccade-related regions. The map of covert shifts of attention demonstrated highest similarity with the map of saccadic eye movements. Gaze perception showed common activation likelihood with the other conditions in the right intraparietal sulcus and in the lateral precentral gyrus. It demonstrated more similarity with the reﬂexive than with the voluntary saccades and shifts of attention. We propose that a core network of frontoparietal and temporal brain regions is recruited when we shift the focus of our attention with or without eye movements in response to the appearance of a visual target, as well as when we see someone else shift his or her gaze.

In current psychological and phenomenological studies on body experience these concepts are confused. This confusion is shown to revolve around the question concerning the status of the body as an intentional object of consciousness. Several criteria that help to differentiate between these two concepts are offered. The body image is a conscious image or representation, owned, but abstract and disintegrated, and appears to be something in-itself, differentiated from its environment. In contrast, the body schema operates in a non-conscious way, is pre-personal, functions holistically, and is not something in-itself apart from its environment.

How are motion and three-dimensional space perceived? In this erudite and witty book, Berthoz describes how human beings on earth perceive and control bodily movement. Reviewing a wealth of research in neurophysiology and experimental psychology, he argues for a rethinking of the traditional separation between action and perception, and for the division of perception into five senses. In Berthoz's view, perception and cognition are inherently predictive, functioning to allow us to anticipate the consequences of current or potential actions. The brain acts like a simulator that is constantly inventing models to project onto the changing world, models that are corrected by steady, minute feedback from the world. We move in the direction we are looking, anticipate the trajectory of a falling ball, recover when we stumble, and continually update our own physical position, all thanks to this sense of movement.This interpretation of perception and action allows Berthoz, in The Brain's Sense of Movement, to focus on psychological phenomena largely ignored in standard texts: proprioception and kinaesthesis, the mechanisms that maintain balance and coordinate actions, and basic perceptual and memory processes involved in navigation.},

            Gender identity is a collection of thoughts and feelings about one’s own gender, which may or may not correspond to the sex assigned at birth. How this sense is linked to the perception of one’s own masculine or feminine body remains unclear. Here, in a series of three behavioral experiments conducted on a large group of control volunteers (N = 140), we show that a perceptual illusion of having the opposite-sex body is associated with a shift toward a more balanced identification with both genders and less gender-stereotypical beliefs about own personality characteristics, as indicated by subjective reports and implicit behavioral measures. These findings demonstrate that the ongoing perception of one’s own body affects the sense of one’s own gender in a dynamic, robust, and automatic manner.},

However, it has also been suggested that a (lack of) sense of ownership over an own body part may in turn inﬂuence bodily processes. This suggestion has previously been supported by the observation that a decrease in skin temperature in the real hand correlated with ownership over the rubber hand. However, this ﬁnding has not been consistently replicated. Our lab has conducted several studies in which we recorded temperature of the hands during the RHI using various measures and in diﬀerent circumstances, including continuous temperature measurements in a temperature-controlled room. An overall analysis of our results, covering ﬁve attempts to replicate the traditional RHI experiment and totalling 167 participants, does not show a reliable cooling of the real hand during the RHI. We discuss this failure to replicate and consider several possible explanations for inconsistencies between reports of hand temperature during the RHI.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that illusory ownership over a mannequin’s body can be induced through synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation as well as through synchronous visuo-vestibular stimulation. The current study aimed to elucidate how three-way combinations of correlated visual, tactile and vestibular signals contribute to the senses of body ownership and self-motion. Visuo-tactile temporal congruence was manipulated by touching the mannequin’s body and the participant’s unseen real body on the trunk with a small object either synchronously or asynchronously. Visuo-vestibular temporal congruence was manipulated by synchronous or asynchronous presentation of a visual motion cue (the background rotating around the mannequin in one direction) and galvanic stimulation of the vestibular nerve generating a rotation sensation (in the same direction). The illusory experiences were quantified using a questionnaire; threat-evoked skin-conductance responses (SCRs) provided complementary indirect physiological evidence for the illusion. Ratings on the illusion questionnaire statement showed significant main effects of synchronous visuovestibular and synchronous visuo-tactile stimulations, suggesting that both of these pairs of bimodal correlations contribute to the ownership illusion. Interestingly, visuo-tactile synchrony dominated because synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation combined with asynchronous visuo-vestibular stimulation elicited a body ownership illusion of similar strength as when both bimodal combinations were synchronous. Moreover, both visuo-tactile and visuo-vestibular synchrony were associated with enhanced self-motion perception; selfmotion sensations were even triggered when visuo-tactile synchrony was combined with visuo-vestibular asynchrony, suggesting that ownership enhanced the relevance of visual information as a self-motion cue. Finally, the SCR results suggest that synchronous stimulation of either modality pair led to a stronger illusion compared to the asynchronous conditions. Collectively, the results suggest that visuo-tactile temporal correlations have a stronger influence on body ownership than visuo-vestibular correlations and that ownership boosts self-motion perception. We present a Bayesian causal inference model that can explain how visuo-vestibular and visuo-tactile information are combined in multisensory own-body perception.},

To address this issue, we developed a detection-­like psychophysics task based on the classic rubber hand illusion paradigm, where participants were asked to report whether the rubber hand felt like their own (the illusion) or not. We manipulated the asynchrony of visual and tactile stimuli delivered to the rubber hand and the hidden real hand under different levels of visual noise. We found that: (1) the probability of the emergence of the rubber hand illusion increased with visual noise and was well predicted by a causal inference model involving the observer computing the probability of the visual and tactile signals coming from a common source; (2) the causal inference model outperformed a non-B­ ayesian model involving the observer not taking into account sensory uncertainty; (3) by comparing body ownership and visuotactile synchrony detection, we found that the prior probability of inferring a common cause for the two types of multisensory percept was correlated but greater for ownership, which suggests that individual differences in rubber hand illusion can be explained at the computational level as differences in how priors are used in the multisensory integration process. These results imply that the same statistical principles determine the perception of the bodily self and the external world.},

            How humans and potentially other animals construct the experience of ”being a self" remains one of the most intriguing questions in neuroscience. Over the past years, substantial advances have been made in understanding psychological mechanisms of bodily self through experimental manipulations in humans, such as rubber-hand illusion in which arbitrary objects may be ascribed with ownership and perceived as part of the self. The present study provides a demonstration in macaque monkeys and establishes objective and quantitative signatures of body representation at a single-trial level. Furthermore, we show that neural signals in macaque’s premotor cortex reflect the strength of illusion and the likelihood of misattributing the illusory arm to oneself, thus, revealing a cortical representation of bodily self-consciousness.
          , 
            The sense of one’s own body is a pillar of self-consciousness and could be investigated by inducing human illusions of artificial objects as part of the self. Here, we present a nonhuman primate version of a rubber-hand illusion that allowed us to determine its computational and neuronal mechanisms. We implemented a video-based system in a reaching task in monkeys and combined a casual inference model to establish an objective and quantitative signature for the monkey’s body representation. Similar to humans, monkeys were more likely to perceive an external object as part of the self when the dynamics (spatial disparity) and the features (shape and structure) of visual (V) input was closer to proprioceptive (P) signals. Neural signals in the monkey’s premotor cortex reflected the strength of illusion and the likelihood of misattributing the illusory hand to oneself, thus, revealing a cortical representation of body ownership.},

It is becoming increasingly accepted that the flaws of the DSM relate to its struggles to pick out “real” entities as opposed to clusters of symptoms. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) was formulated in response to this failure, and attempts to address the concerns confronting the DSM by shifting to a causal and continuous model of psychopathology. Noting key criticisms of neurocentricism and problems with conceptual validity leveled at the RDoC, we argue that they stem from its grounding in the metaphysical position of eliminative materialism, or at least material-reductionism. We propose that 3e cognition (viewing the mind as embodied, embedded, and enactive) offers a superior alternative to eliminative materialism. A 3e-informed framework of mental disorder is sketched out and its advantages as a basis for classifying and conceptualizing mental disorders are considered.},

	abstract = {The estimation of the correct number of dimensions is a long-standing problem in psychometrics. Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis (PA), Kaiser-Guttman’s eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, multiple average partial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes as BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple structure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of dimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional techniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called exploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with the regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is verified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify communities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known factor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number of factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000 and 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70), resulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were simulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to parallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to Kaiser-Guttman rule in a number of situations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the only technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the four-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an accuracy of 100\% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was used to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare its performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study.},

In 2016, the US congress identiﬁed a list of Russian statesponsored Twitter accounts that were used to try to divide voters on a wide range of issues. Previous research used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to estimate latent topics in data extracted from these accounts. However, LDA has characteristics that may limit the effectiveness of its use on data from social media: The number of latent topics must be speciﬁed by the user, interpretability of the topics can be difﬁcult to achieve, and it does not model short-term temporal dynamics. In the current paper, we propose a new method to estimate latent topics in texts from social media termed Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA). In a Monte Carlo simulation, we compared the ability of DynEGA and LDA to estimate the number of simulated latent topics. The results show that DynEGA is substantially more accurate than several different LDA algorithms when estimating the number of simulated topics. In an applied example, we performed DynEGA on a large dataset with Twitter posts from state-sponsored right- and left-wing trolls during the 2016 US presidential election. DynEGA revealed topics that were pertinent to several consequential events in the election cycle, demonstrating the coordinated effort of trolls capitalizing on current events in the USA. This example demonstrates the potential power of our approach for revealing temporally relevant information from qualitative text data.},

The neural mechanism underlying the integration of this information remains unclear. In this study, we propose a neural model subdividing self-processing into three intimately connected levels with diﬀerent extension: Interoceptive-processing, Exteroceptive-processing and Mental-self-processing. We applied ALE meta-analyses on neuroimaging studies to analyze their neural patterns. Our results show common involvement of insula across all three levels including diﬀerentiation of self and familiarity. Common activities in Exteroceptive- and Mentalself-processing were found in the anteromedial prefrontal cortex (AMPFC) and the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), suggesting that the two regions likely serve basic functions in diﬀerentiation and integration of self-other information. Finally, Mental-self-processing involves extensive regions such as the cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, in addition to the insula, AMPFC and TPJ, which could specialize in adding self-relatedness to environment information. We conclude that there is a gradient organization in self-processing, through which body-environment information is integrated for the self via propagation from Interoceptive-processing to Mental-self-processing.},

A novelty of the analysis is that it exploits information on the period individuals recall as the happiest in their lives. Data come from SHARELIFE 2008/09, a retrospective life survey conducted in 13 European countries among individuals aged 50 or more. Using this information, I build a longitudinal data set that extends across the whole lifespan of respondents. The probability of living a happiest year in life at each age is estimated through a conditional fixed effects logit model. Results show that the likelihood of living the happiest period in life exhibits a concave relationship with age, with a turning point at about 30–34 years and a decreasing trend from that point onward. Retrospectively, midlife is not perceived as the least likely happiest period in life. These patterns persist even after controlling for usual correlates of subjective well-being, and they are rather stable across cohorts and genders despite presenting certain variability across European countries.},

We argue that the self serves as a stable anchor across different forms of judgment and that referring a stimulus to ourselves enhances the binding of stimulus features at different stages of processing (e.g., in perception and in memory) and also the binding between processing stages. There is neural evidence that self-biases reflect an underlying neural network that interacts with but is independent of attentional control networks in the brain, and that damage to the self-related network disrupts the bias effects. We discuss the implications for understanding the nature of the self.},

How temporal integration on the psychological level of the self is related to temporal integration on the neuronal level remains unclear. To investigate temporal integration on the psychological level, we modified a wellestablished self-matching paradigm by inserting temporal delays. On the neuronal level, we indexed temporal integration in resting-state EEG by two related measures of scale-free dynamics, the power law exponent and autocorrelation window. We hypothesized that the previously established self-prioritization effect, measured as decreased response times or increased accuracy for self-related stimuli, would change with the insertion of different temporal delays between the paired stimuli, and that these changes would be related to temporal integration on the neuronal level. We found a significant self-prioritization effect on accuracy in all conditions with delays, indicating stronger temporal integration of self-related stimuli. Further, we observed a relationship between temporal integration on psychological and neuronal levels: higher degrees of neuronal integration, that is, higher power-law exponent and longer autocorrelation window, during resting-state EEG were related to a stronger increase in the self-prioritization effect across longer temporal delays. We conclude that temporal integration on the neuronal level serves as a template for temporal integration of the self on the psychological level. Temporal integration can thus be conceived as the “common currency” of neuronal and psychological levels of self.},

	abstract = {The self is the core of our mental life. Previous investigations have demonstrated a strong neural overlap between self-related activity and resting state activity. This suggests that information about self-relatedness is encoded in our brain’s spontaneous activity. The exact neuronal mechanisms of such “rest-self containment,” however, remain unclear. The present EEG study investigated temporal measures of resting state EEG to relate them to self-consciousness. This was obtained with the self-consciousness scale (SCS) which measures Private, Public, and Social dimensions of self. We demonstrate positive correlations between Private self-consciousness and three temporal measures of resting state activity: scale-free activity as indexed by the power-law exponent (PLE), the auto-correlation window (ACW), and modulation index (MI). Specifically, higher PLE, longer ACW, and stronger MI were related to higher degrees of Private self-consciousness. Finally, conducting eLORETA for spatial tomography, we found significant correlation of Private self-consciousness with activity in cortical midline structures such as the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. These results were reinforced with a data-driven analysis; a machine learning algorithm accurately predicted an individual as having a “high” or “low” Private self-consciousness score based on these measures of the brain’s spatiotemporal structure. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Private selfconsciousness is related to the temporal structure of resting state activity as featured by temporal nestedness (PLE), temporal continuity (ACW), and temporal integration (MI). Our results support the hypothesis that self-related information is temporally contained in the brain’s resting state. “Rest-self containment” can thus be featured by a temporal signature.},

	abstract = {Networks are gaining popularity as an alternative to latent variable models for representing psychological constructs. Whereas latent variable approaches introduce unobserved common causes to explain the relations among observed variables, network approaches posit direct causal relations between observed variables. While these approaches lead to radically different understandings of the psychological constructs of interest, recent articles have established mathematical equivalences that hold between network models and latent variable models. We argue that the fact that for any model from one class there is an equivalent model from the other class does not mean that both models are equally plausible accounts of the data-generating mechanism. In many cases the constraints that are meaningful in one framework translate to constraints in the equivalent model that lack a clear interpretation in the other framework. Finally, we discuss three diverging predictions for the relation between zero-order correlations and partial correlations implied by sparse network models and unidimensional factor models. We propose a test procedure that compares the likelihoods of these models in light of these diverging implications. We use an empirical example to illustrate our argument.},

	abstract = {Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a risk factor for numerous mental disorders. However, the specificity of CM types in mental disorders is still being discussed. The present study examined the prevalence of five CM types in patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (SZ; n = 107), bipolar disorder (BD; n = 103), depression (MDD; n = 604; with the two subgroups Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) and non-chronic MDD), and in healthy controls (HC; n = 715). Additionally, associations between CM types, symptom severity, and age of onset were investigated. The prevalence of all CM types was higher in the patient groups compared to HC. Emotional neglect, emotional abuse, and physical neglect were reported most frequently in all groups. Notably, patients with PDD reported more CM of all types than patients with non-chronic MDD. The severity of depression was associated with emotional abuse and neglect; anxiety with emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and sexual abuse; positive SZ symptoms with physical neglect; negative symptoms with emotional and physical neglect; and mania with sexual abuse and physical neglect. CM was associated with a younger age of onset in MDD and BD. The high prevalence of CM in patients with severe mental disorders highlights the importance of considering this issue in the treatment of such patients.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine attachment insecurity and low social support as potential mediators of the association between childhood maltreatment (CM) types and depression severity in patients with a lifetime history of major depressive disorders (MDD).
Method: Participants with an acute or remitted MDD (N = 580) completed questionnaires about CM (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), attachment (Relationship Scales Questionnaire), social support (Social Support Questionnaire), and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory). Mediation and path models with CM types as independent variables, attachment avoidance and anxiety as mediators and depression severity as dependent variable were calculated. In addition, a sequential mediation model with attachment insecurity and social support as mediators of the association between CM and depression was tested.
Results: Attachment avoidance and anxiety partially mediated the eﬀect of CM on depression. In the path model including the diﬀerent CM types, there were signiﬁcant indirect eﬀects of emotional abuse on depression via attachment anxiety and of emotional neglect on depression via attachment avoidance. Results also supported the hypothesized sequential mediation via attachment insecurity and social support. Limitations: A cross-sectional design with a retrospective self-report measure of CM was used and the developmental timing of exposure to CM was not considered.
Conclusion: Our ﬁndings suggest that the eﬀect of emotional abuse and emotional neglect on depression is partially mediated by attachment avoidance and anxiety. Further, the results support the hypothesis of a sequential mediation via attachment insecurity and social support. Accordingly, attachment insecurity is discussed as a target of psychotherapy for patients with MDD and CM.},

	abstract = {Psychological network approaches propose to see symptoms or questionnaire items as interconnected nodes, with links between them reﬂecting pairwise statistical dependencies evaluated on cross-sectional, time-series, or panel data. These networks constitute an established methodology to assess the interactions and relative importance of nodes/indicators, providing an important complement to other approaches such as factor analysis. However, focusing the modelling solely on pairwise relationships can neglect potentially critical information shared by groups of three or more variables in the form of higher-order interdependencies. To overcome this important limitation, here we propose an information-theoretic framework based on hypergraphs as psychometric models. As edges in hypergraphs are capable of encompassing several nodes together, this extension can thus provide a richer representation of the interactions that may exist among sets of psychological variables. Our results show how psychometric hypergraphs can highlight meaningful redundant and synergistic interactions on either simulated or state-of-art, re-analyzed psychometric datasets. Overall, our framework extends current network approaches while leading to new ways of assessing the data that diﬀer at their core from other methods, extending the psychometric toolbox and opening promising avenues for future investigation.},

Overall, they manipulated the identity of the fake body, and/or its spatial perspective, and/or the kind of multisensory stimulation, and/or its spatiotemporal congruency. The effects were measured through implicit and/or explicit indices. In summary, results showed that participants’ behavior shifted away from the self and/or towards that of the embodied fake/ virtual body. The findings have been interpreted within various exploratory frameworks, with the most common being the Proteus effect, the cortical body matrix and the inverse model of motor control.

It underwent revision after revision, spanning almost 20 years in one of the most fertile periods of the philosopher's life. The book owes its form to the work of many hands, and its unity is one that has been imposed on it. Yet there is nothing here that cannot be traced back to Hussed himself. Indeed, the final" clean copy" for publication, prepared by an assistant, was completely reviewed by the master three times and emended by him in detail on each occasion. Nevertheless, in the end the work was in fact not submitted for publication, and after Hussed's pen last touched the manuscript in 1928 it was set aside until posthumously edited and published by the Hussed-Archives in 1952. The story of the composition of Ideas II begins with the "pencil manuscript" of 1912. This is the ultimate textual source for both Ideas II and Ideas III. 2 It has been preserved as a folio of 84 sheets in very dense shorthand of the Gabelsberger system, written mostly with a pencil. It was composed by Hussed "in one stroke" immediately after the completion of I Edmund Husser!: Ideen zu einer reinen Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologischen Philosophie.

We observed opposite parametric modulation of self‐relatedness and emotion dimensions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, whereas neural activity in subcortical regions (tectum, right amygdala, hypothalamus) was modulated by self‐relatedness and emotion dimensions in the same direction. In sum, our results demonstrate that self‐relatedness is closely linked to emotion dimensions of valence and intensity in many lower subcortical brain regions involved in basic emotional systems and, at the same time, distinct from them in higher cortical regions that mediate cognitive processes necessary for becoming aware of one's self, for example self‐consciousness.

	abstract = {Significance
            An established theoretical model, predictive coding, states that the brain is constantly building models (signifying changing predictions) of the environment. The brain does this by forming predictions and signaling sensory inputs which deviate from predictions (“prediction errors”). Various hypotheses exist about how predictive coding could be implemented in the brain. We recorded neural spiking and oscillations with laminar resolution in a network of cortical areas as monkeys performed a working memory task with changing stimulus predictability. Predictability modulated the patterns of feedforward/feedback flow, cortical layers, and oscillations used to process a visual stimulus. These data support the theory of predictive coding but suggest an alternate model for its neural implementation: predictive routing.
          , 
            In predictive coding, experience generates predictions that attenuate the feeding forward of predicted stimuli while passing forward unpredicted “errors.” Different models have suggested distinct cortical layers, and rhythms implement predictive coding. We recorded spikes and local field potentials from laminar electrodes in five cortical areas (visual area 4 [V4], lateral intraparietal [LIP], posterior parietal area 7A, frontal eye field [FEF], and prefrontal cortex [PFC]) while monkeys performed a task that modulated visual stimulus predictability. During predictable blocks, there was enhanced alpha (8 to 14 Hz) or beta (15 to 30 Hz) power in all areas during stimulus processing and prestimulus beta (15 to 30 Hz) functional connectivity in deep layers of PFC to the other areas. Unpredictable stimuli were associated with increases in spiking and in gamma-band (40 to 90 Hz) power/connectivity that fed forward up the cortical hierarchy via superficial-layer cortex. Power and spiking modulation by predictability was stimulus specific. Alpha/beta power in LIP, FEF, and PFC inhibited spiking in deep layers of V4. Area 7A uniquely showed increases in high-beta (∼22 to 28 Hz) power/connectivity to unpredictable stimuli. These results motivate a conceptual model, predictive routing. It suggests that predictive coding may be implemented via lower-frequency alpha/beta rhythms that “prepare” pathways processing-predicted inputs by inhibiting feedforward gamma rhythms and associated spiking.},

Advances in resting-state functional connectivity analyses are beginning to reveal increasingly complex patterns of organization within the key nodes of the DMN – medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex – as well as between these nodes and other brain systems. Here we review recent examinations of the relationships between the DMN and various aspects of self-relevant and social-cognitive processing in light of emerging evidence for heterogeneity within this network. Drawing from a rapidly evolving social-cognitive neuroscience literature, we propose that embodied simulation and mentalizing are processes which allow us to gain insight into another’s physical and mental state by providing privileged access to our own physical and mental states. Embodiment implies that the same neural systems are engaged for self- and other-understanding through a simulation mechanism, while mentalizing refers to the use of high-level conceptual information to make inferences about the mental states of self and others. These mechanisms work together to provide a coherent representation of the self and by extension, of others. Nodes of the DMN selectively interact with brain systems for embodiment and mentalizing, including the mirror neuron system, to produce appropriate mappings in the service of social-cognitive demands.},

This is done providing converging data from psychopathological evidence (phenomenal), phenomenological contructs (transphenomenal) and neuroscientiﬁc measures (pre-phenomenal). The phenomenal level is the detailed documentation of the patients’ subjective anomalous experiences. These phenomena are explicit contents in the patients’ ﬁeld of consciousness. The trans-phenomenal level targets the implicit yet operative matrix that underlies these anomalous subjective experiences. Abnormal phenomena are viewed as expressions of a modiﬁcation of trans-phenomenal matrix, that is, in terms of an abnormal synthesis or integration through time of intero-, proprio- and extero-ceptive stimuli. Finally, we link the abnormalities of the trans-phenomenal matrix to pre-phenomenal alterations of the brain resting state and of its spatio-temporal organization, as documented by neurobiological methods providing spatial and temporal resolution of intrinsic brain activity (with many features of the resting state remaining yet unclear though). Based on phenomenological research, the body in schizophrenia is typically experienced in an itemized way as an object external to one’s self and unrelated to events in the external world. Based on neurobiological data, we tentatively hypothesize that such anomalies of the lived body are related to decreased integration between intero-, extero- and proprioceptive experiences by the brain’s spontaneous activity and its temporal structure. Taken all together, this suggests that we view abnormalities of bodily experience in terms of their underlying abnormal spatiotemporal features which, as we suppose, can be traced back to the spatiotemporal features of the brain’s spontaneous activity.},

We correlated frequency-speciﬁc directed inﬂuences among 28 pairs of visual areas with anatomical metrics of the feedforward or feedback character of the respective interareal projections. This revealed that in the primate visual system, feedforward inﬂuences are carried by theta-band (\$4 Hz) and gamma-band (\$60–80 Hz) synchronization, and feedback inﬂuences by beta-band (\$14–18 Hz) synchronization. The functional directed inﬂuences constrain a functional hierarchy similar to the anatomical hierarchy, but exhibiting task-dependent dynamic changes in particular with regard to the hierarchical positions of frontal areas.

	abstract = {Conceptual self-awareness is a mental state in which the content of one’s consciousness refers to a particular aspect of semantic knowledge about oneself. This form of consciousness plays a crucial role in shaping human behavior; however, little is known about its neural basis. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a visual masked priming paradigm to dissociate the neural responses related to the awareness of semantic autobiographical information (one’s own name, surname, etc.) from the awareness of information related to any visual stimulus (perceptual awareness), as well as from the unaware processing of self-relevant stimuli. To detect brain activity that is highly selective for selfrelevant information, we used the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) adaptation approach, which goes beyond the spatial limitations of conventional fMRI. We found that self-awareness was associated with BOLD adaptation in the medial frontopolar-retrosplenial areas, whereas perceptual awareness and unaware self-processing were associated with BOLD adaptation in the lateral fronto-parietal areas and the inferior temporal cortex, respectively. Thus, using a direct manipulation of conscious awareness we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the neural basis of conceptual self-awareness is neuroanatomically distinct from the network mediating perceptual awareness of the sensory environment or unaware processing of self-related stimuli.},

	abstract = {The extrastriate body area (EBA) is one among the multiple, functionally specialized regions of the human visual cortex exhibiting modulation by body-related stimuli. Here we investigate whether activation patterns differ for the perception of one’s own body and the bodies of others. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify body-related brain areas and to see how these areas differentiate between images of one’s own body and those of others in the absence of facial or motion cues. Whole brain explorative group-level analysis identiﬁed body-related blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal enhancement in ﬁve regions of the right and in one region of the left hemisphere (right: in the extrastriate visual and parietal cortex and in the precentral gyrus, left: in the extrastriate visual cortex). General linear model group-level random effects analysis of the self–other contrast revealed self-related responses in the extrastriate and parietal regions in the right hemisphere but also in the right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest the existence of a cortical network for the extraction of body-related information and another cortical network for the extraction of self-related body information. The two networks partially overlap in the right superior and inferior parietal cortices, but are clearly segregated in the extrastriate visual cortex and in the middle frontal gyrus. In addition, we report that the classical EBA is only involved in the analysis of body-related information but not in the assignment of body identity. The latter appears to be accomplished by a network in right hemisphere comprising the fusiform body area, regions of the superior parietal lobe, the inferior parietal cortex, and the middle frontal gyrus.

When triggered, participants had to fill in short surveys on affect, situational characteristics and event characteristics on their smartphone. We found theoretically expected relationships between the skin conductance signal on the one hand and self–reported arousal and positive energy (e.g. energetic and enthusiastic) on the other hand, although effect sizes were small. Unexpectedly, none of the negative affective scales (i.e. irritation, anxiety, and negative valence) were predicted by skin conductance levels. Despite the (partial) validity of the signal, a simple algorithm that triggered the survey based on relative increases of skin conductance levels produced counterintuitive results due to a dependence between level and slope. Additional exploratory analyses highlighted other skin conductance signal characteristics (i.e. autocorrelation, number of peaks, and change points) that might be worth examining when designing future algorithms to sample arousing moments. Overall, our experiences highlight not only the promise but also the complexity of real–time measurement of physiological processes in daily life. © 2020 The Authors.

The system consisted of preprocessing, feature extraction and pattern classiﬁcation stages. Preprocessing and feature extraction methods were devised so that emotion-speciﬁc characteristics could be extracted from short-segment signals. Although the features were carefully extracted, their distribution formed a classiﬁcation problem, with large overlap among clusters and large variance within clusters. A support vector machine was adopted as a pattern classiﬁer to resolve this difﬁculty. Correct-classiﬁcation ratios for 50 subjects were 78.4\% and 61.8\%, for the recognition of three and four categories, respectively.},

Nevertheless, in such studies, differences in socio-economic-educational status have not always been accounted for, with idiomatic translation of emotional concepts being a limitation, and the underlying psychophysiological mechanisms still un-researched. We set out to investigate whether native residents from Guinea-Bissau (West African culture) and Portugal (Western European culture)—matched for socio-economic-educational status, sex and language—varied in behavioural and autonomic system response during emotion recognition of nonverbal vocalizations from Portuguese individuals. Overall, Guinea–Bissauans (as out-group) responded significantly less accurately (corrected p {\textless} .05), slower, and showed a trend for higher concomitant skin conductance, compared to Portuguese (as in-group)—findings which may indicate a higher cognitive effort stemming from higher difficulty in discerning emotions from another culture. Specifically, accuracy differences were particularly found for pleasure, amusement, and anger, rather than for sadness, relief or fear. Nevertheless, both cultures recognized all emotions above-chance level. The perceived authenticity, measured for the first time in nonverbal cross-cultural research, in the same vocalizations, retrieved no difference between cultures in accuracy, but still a slower response from the out-group. Lastly, we provide—to our knowledge—a first account of how skin conductance response varies between nonverbally vocalized emotions, with significant differences (p {\textless} .05). In sum, we provide behavioural and psychophysiological data, demographically and language-matched, that supports cultural and emotion effects on vocal emotion recognition and perceived authenticity, as well as the universality hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Stress can lead to harmful conditions in the body, such as anxiety disorders and depression. One of the promising noninvasive methods, which has been widely used in detecting stress and emotion, is electrodermal activity (EDA). EDA has a tonic and phasic component called skin conductance level and skin conductance response (SCR). However, the components of the EDA cannot be directly extracted and need to be deconvolved to obtain it. The EDA signals were collected from 18 healthy subjects that underwent three sessions – Stroop test with increasing stress levels. The EDA signals were then deconvoluted by using continuous deconvolution analysis (CDA) and convex optimization approach to electrodermal activity (cvxEDA). Four features from the result of the deconvolution process were collected, namely sample average, standard deviation, first absolute difference, and normalized first absolute difference. Those features were used as the input of the classification process using the extreme learning machine (ELM). The output of classification was the stress level; mild, moderate, and severe. The visual of the phasic component using cvxEDA is more precise or smoother than the CDA’s result. However, both methods could separate SCR from the original skin conductivity raw and indicate the small peaks from the SCR. The classification process results showed that both CDA and cvxEDA methods with 50 hidden layers in ELM had a high accuracy in classifying the stress level, which was 95.56\% and 94.45\%, respectively. This study developed a stress level classification method using ELM and the statistical features of SCR. The result showed that EDA could classify the stress level with over 94\% accuracy. This system could help people monitor their mental health during overworking, leading to anxiety and depression because of untreated stress.},

Results demonstrated that, of the included measures, the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness-2 provided the closest and most precise measurement of the core interoceptive sensibility construct (i.e., core of the entire investigated item pool). The Body Awareness Questionnaire and the Private Body Consciousness Scale were also centrally located measures, while the Body Perception Questionnaire and the Body Responsiveness Scale appear to tap more distal aspects of the core construct. We discuss implications for interpreting complicated data patterns using measures of interoceptive sensibility and, more generally, for measuring the construct of interoceptive sensibility.},

This cross-sectional study examined its typical development in 138 children (8–17 years) and a group of 14 healthy young adults using a fast and novel psychophysical test that yielded objective measures of position sense acuity. Participants placed their hands underneath a computer tablet and judged the perceived position of their unseen index finger relative to two visible areas displayed on a tablet following a two-forced-choice paradigm. Responses were fitted to a psychometric acuity function from which the difference between the point-of-subjective-equality and the veridical finger position (DPSE) was derived as a measure of position sense bias, and the uncertainty area (UA) as a measure of precision. The main results are: First, children under 12 exhibited a significantly greater UA than adults while adolescent children (13–17 years) exhibited no significant differences when compared to adults. Second, no significant age-related differences in DPSE were found across the age range of 8–17 years. This implies that the typical development of finger position sense from late childhood to adulthood is characterized as an agedependent increase in proprioceptive precision and not as a decrease in bias.},

            Many people experience mild stress in modern society which raises the need for an improved understanding of psychophysiological responses to stressors. Heart rate variability (HRV) may be associated with a flexible network of intricate neural structures which are dynamically organized to cope with diverse challenges. HRV was obtained in thirty-three healthy participants performing a cognitive task both with and without added stressors. Markers of neural autonomic control and neurovisceral complexity (entropy) were computed from HRV time series. Based on individual anxiety responses to the experimental stressors, two subgroups were identified: anxiety responders and non-responders. While both vagal and entropy markers rose during the cognitive task alone in both subgroups, only entropy decreased when stressors were added and exclusively in anxiety responders. We conclude that entropy may be a promising marker of cognitive tasks and acute mild stress. It brings out a new central question: why is entropy the only marker affected by mild stress? Based on the neurovisceral integration model, we hypothesized that neurophysiological complexity may be altered by mild stress, which is reflected in entropy of the cardiac output signal. The putative role of the amygdala during mild stress, in modulating the complexity of a coordinated neural network linking brain to heart, is discussed.},

	abstract = {The use of heart rate variability (HRV) in research has been greatly popularized over the past decades due to the ease and affordability of HRV collection, coupled with its clinical relevance and signiﬁcant relationships with psychophysiological constructs and psychopathological disorders. Despite the wide use of electrocardiograms (ECG) in research and advancements in sensor technology, the analytical approach and steps applied to obtain HRV measures can be seen as complex. Thus, this poses a challenge to users who may not have the adequate background knowledge to obtain the HRV indices reliably. To maximize the impact of HRV-related research and its reproducibility, parallel advances in users’ understanding of the indices and the standardization of analysis pipelines in its utility will be crucial. This paper addresses this gap and aims to provide an overview of the most up-to-date and commonly used HRV indices, as well as common research areas in which these indices have proven to be very useful, particularly in psychology. In addition, we also provide a step-by-step guide on how to perform HRV analysis using an integrative neurophysiological toolkit, NeuroKit2.},

Participants rated their feelings of embodiment over the avatar and also estimated the sizes of their body and objects in the environment. Unlike adults, children embodied the avatar regardless of visuomotor congruency. Both adults and children freely embodied different-sized avatars, and this affected their size perception in the surrounding virtual environment; they felt that objects were larger in a small body and vice versa in a large body. In addition, children felt that their body had grown in the large body condition.

Here, we investigated how body ownership and agency recovered following body schema distortion in a virtual reality environment along with two kinds of motor memories: memories that were rapidly updated and memories that were gradually updated. We found that, although agency and body ownership recovered in parallel, the recovery of body ownership was predicted by fast memories and that of agency was predicted by slow memories.

              Knowledge of one’s own body size is a crucial facet of body representation, both for acting on the environment and perhaps also for constraining body ownership. However, representations of body size may be somewhat plastic, particularly to allow for physical growth in childhood. Here we report a developmental investigation into the role of hand size in body representation (the sense of body ownership, perception of hand position, and perception of own-hand size). Using the rubber hand illusion paradigm, this study used different fake hand sizes (60\%, 80\%, 100\%, 120\% or 140\% of typical size) in three age groups (6- to 7-year-olds, 12- to 13-year-olds, and adults;
              N
               = 229). We found no evidence that hand size constrains ownership or position: participants embodied hands which were both larger and smaller than their own, and indeed judged their own hands to have changed size following the illusion. Children and adolescents embodied the fake hands more than adults, with a greater tendency to feel their own hand had changed size. Adolescents were particularly sensitive to multisensory information. In sum, we found substantial plasticity in the representation of own-body size, with partial support for the hypothesis that children have looser representations than adults.},

We provide a bird’s eye view on studies that interpreted their findings in light of at least one of four leading neuroscientific theories of consciousness (N=412 experiments), asking how methodological choices of the researchers might affect the final conclusions. We found that supporting a specific theory can be predicted solely from methodological choices, irrespective of findings. Furthermore, most studies interpret their findings post-hoc, rather than a-priori testing critical predictions of the theories. Our results highlight challenges for the field and provide researchers with a unique, open-access website to further analyze trends in the neuroscience of consciousness.},

	abstract = {Some recent papers by P. Lush and colleagues have argued that the rubber hand illusion (RHI), where participants can feel a rubber hand as their own under appropriate multisensory stimulation, may be caused mainly by hypnotic suggestibility and expectations (demand characteristics). These papers rely primarily on a study with 353 participants who took part in a RHI experiment carried out in a classical way with brush stroking. Participants experienced a synchronous condition where the rubber hand was seen to be touched in synchrony with touch felt on their corresponding hidden real hand, or the touches were applied asynchronously as a control. Each participant had a related measure of their hypnotisability on a scale known as the Sussex-Waterloo Scale of Hypnotisability (SWASH). The authors found a correlation between the questionnaire ratings of the RHI in the synchronous condition and the SWASH score. From this, they concluded that the RHI is largely driven by suggestibility and further proposed that suggestibility and expectations may even entirely explain the RHI. Here we examine their claims in a series of extensive new analyses of their data. We ﬁnd that at every level of SWASH, the synchronous stimulation results in greater levels of the illusion than the asynchronous condition; moreover, proprioceptive drift is greater in the synchronous case at every level of SWASH. Thus, while the level of hypnotisability does modestly inﬂuence the subjective reports (higher SWASH is associated with somewhat higher illusion ratings), the major difference between the synchronous and asynchronous stimulation is always present. Furthermore, by including in the model the participants’ expectancy ratings of how strongly they initially believed they would experience the RHI in the two conditions, we show that expectations had a very small effect on the illusion ratings; model comparisons further demonstrate that the multisensory condition is two-to-three-times as dominant as the other factors, with hypnotisability contributing modestly and expectations negligibly. Thus, although the results indicate that trait suggestibility may modulate the RHI, presumably through intersubject variations in top-down factors, the ﬁndings also suggest that the primary explanation for the RHI is as a multisensory bodily illusion.},

	abstract = {Disturbances in self-monitoring are core symptoms of schizophrenia. Some research suggests an over-reliance on exteroceptive cues and a reduced weighting of self-generated interoceptive signals to guide perception. The vestibular sense provides important self-generated information about the body in space. Alterations of vestibular function are reported in schizophrenia, but it is unknown whether internally generated vestibular information is discounted in favour of exteroceptive input. In this study, we test for evidence of an over-reliance on extero­ ceptive visual cues and a reduced weighting of vestibular signals in guiding perception. In a group of individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, we used a well-studied visual illusion – the Tilt Illusion – to probe the respective weight given to visual and vestibular cues in judging line orientation. The Tilt Illusion reveals that perceived orientation of a vertical grating is biased by the orientation in its surround. This illusion increases when the head is tilted, due to the reduced reliability of vestibular information that would otherwise provide an internally generated reference for vertical. We predicted that an over-reliance on exteroceptive cues in schizo­ phrenia would lead to a reduced susceptibility to the effects of head position on Tilt Illusion strength. We find no difference between patients and controls. Both groups show comparable Tilt Illusion magnitudes that increase when the head is tilted. Thus, our findings suggest that chronic patients with schizophrenia adequately combine self-generated vestibular cues and exteroceptive visual input to judge line verticality. A stronger reliance on exteroceptive information over internally generated signals in guiding perception is not evident in our data. Deficits in self-monitoring might therefore be modality specific or state dependant.},

We review and discuss recent developmental and adult findings, pointing to the central role of interpersonal affective touch in body awareness and social cognition in health and disorders.

Top-down factors such as culture, personal relationships, setting, gender, and other contextual influences are also important in defining and interpreting social touch. The critical role of social touch throughout the lifespan is considered, with special attention to infancy and young childhood, a time during which social touch and its neural, behavioral, and physiological contingencies contribute to reinforcement-based learning and impact a variety of developmental trajectories.

On the basis of previous research, we assumed that manipulating visual feedbacks may guide and inﬂuence, under certain conditions, the phenomenal experience of touch. To this aim, we used the Tactile Quadrant Stimulation (TQS) test in which subjects, in the crucial condition, must indicate whether and where they perceive a double tactile stimulation applied simultaneously in different quadrants of the two hands (asymmetrical Double Simultaneous Stimulation trial, Asym-DSS). The task was performed with the left-hand out of sight and the right-hand reﬂected in a mirror so that the right-hand reﬂected in the mirror looks like the own left-hand. We found that in the Asym-DSS trial, the vision of the right-hand reﬂected in the mirror and stimulated by a tactile stimulus elicited on the left-hand the sensation of having been touched in the same quadrant as the right-hand. In other words, we found in healthy subjects the same phantom touch effect that we previously found in patients. We interpreted these results as modulation of tactile representation by bottom-up (multisensory integration of stimuli coming from the right real and the right reﬂected hand) and possibly top-down (body ownership distortion) processing triggered by our experimental setup, unveiling bilateral representation of touch.},

	abstract = {Sensory information can temporarily affect mental body representations. For example, in Virtual Reality (VR), visually swapping into a body with another sex can temporarily alter perceived gender identity. Outside of VR, real-time auditory changes to walkers’ footstep sounds can affect perceived body weight and masculinity/femininity. Here, we investigate whether altered footstep sounds also impact gender identity and relation to gender groups. In two experiments, cisgender participants (26 females, 26 males) walked with headphones which played altered versions of their own footstep sounds that sounded more typically male or female. Baseline and post-intervention measures quantiﬁed gender identity [Implicit Association Test (IAT)], relation to gender groups [Inclusion of the Other-in-the-Self (IOS)], and perceived masculinity/femininity. Results show that females felt more feminine and closer to the group of women (IOS) directly after walking with feminine sounding footsteps. Similarly, males felt more feminine after walking with feminine sounding footsteps and associated themselves relatively stronger with “female” (IAT). The ﬁndings suggest that gender identity is temporarily malleable through auditory-induced own body illusions. Furthermore, they provide evidence for a connection between body perception and an abstract representation of the Self, supporting the theory that bodily illusions affect social cognition through changes in the self-concept.},

	abstract = {Own-perceived body matching – the ability to match one’s own body with an observed body – is a difficult task for both general and clinical populations. Thus far, however, own-perceived body matching has been investigated in situations that are incongruent with how we are used to experience and perceive our body in daily life. In the current study, we aimed to examine own-perceived body matching in a context that more closely resembles real life. More specifically, we investigated the effects of body movement dynamics and clothing cues on own-perceived body matching. We asked participants to match their own body with an externally perceived body that was a 3D-generated avatar based on participants’ real bodies, fitted with a computer-generated dress. This perceived body was (1) either static (non-walking avatar) or dynamic (walking avatar), (2) either bigger, smaller, or the same size as participants’ own body size, and (3) fitted with a dress with a size either bigger, smaller, or the same as participants’ own dress size. Our results suggest that movement dynamics cues did not improve the accuracy of own-perceived body matching, but that confidence about dress fit was higher for dynamic avatars, and that the difference between dynamic and static avatars was dependent on participants’ self-esteem. Furthermore, when participants were asked to rate the observed body in reference to how they wanted to represent themselves to others, dynamic avatars were rated lower than static avatars for the biggest-sized bodies only, possibly reflecting the influence of movement cues on amplifying socio-cultural stereotypes. Finally, while smaller body/dress sizes were systematically rated higher than bigger body/dress sizes for several self-report items, the interplay between body and dress size played an important role in participants’ self-report as well. Thus, while our research suggests that movement and garment dynamics, allowing for realistic, concrete situations that are reminiscent of daily life, influence own-body perception, these cues did not lead to an improvement in accuracy. These findings provide important insights for research exploring (own-) body perception and bodily self-awareness, with practical (e.g., development of online avatars) and clinical (e.g., anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder) implications.},

Whilst adults have been shown to integrate these sources in an optimal fashion, few studies have investigated how children integrate visual and proprioceptive information when localizing the body. The current study used a mediated reality device called MIRAGE to explore how the brain weighs visual and proprioceptive information in a hand localization task across early childhood. Sixty-four children aged 4–11 years estimated the position of their index ﬁnger after viewing congruent or incongruent visuoproprioceptive information regarding hand position. A developmental trajectory analysis was carried out to explore the effect of age on condition. An age effect was only found in the incongruent condition which resulted in greater mislocalization of the hand toward the visual representation as age increased. Estimates by younger children were closer to the true location of the hand compared to those by older children indicating less weighting of visual information. Regression analyses showed localizations errors in the incongruent seen condition could not be explained by proprioceptive accuracy or by general attention or social differences. This suggests that the way in which visual and proprioceptive information are integrated optimizes throughout development, with the bias toward visual information increasing with age.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Much work has been dedicated to understanding the effects of adverse home environments on brain development. While the school social and learning environment plays a role in child development, little work has been done to investigate the impact of the school environment on the developing brain. The goal of the present study was to examine associations between the school environment, brain structure and connectivity, and mental health.
METHODS: In this preregistered study we investigated these questions in a large sample of adolescents (9–10 years of age) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We examined the association between school environment and gray matter (n = 10,435) and white matter (n = 10,770) structure and functional connectivity (n = 9528). We then investigated multivariate relationships between school-associated brain measures and mental health.
RESULTS: School environment was associated with connectivity of the auditory and retrosplenial temporal network as well as of higher-order cognitive networks like the cingulo-opercular, default mode, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks. Multivariate analyses revealed that connectivity of the cingulo-opercular and default mode networks was also associated with mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings shed light on the neural mechanisms through which favorable school environments may contribute to positive mental health outcomes in children. Our ﬁndings have implications for interventions targeted at promoting positive youth functioning through improving school environments.},

	abstract = {Background: Earlier pubertal timing is associated with higher rates of depressive disorders in adolescence. Neuroimaging studies report brain structural associations with both pubertal timing and depression. However, whether brain structure mediates the relationship between pubertal timing and depression remains unclear.
Methods: The current registered report examined associations between pubertal timing (indexed via perceived pubertal development), brain structure (cortical and subcortical metrics, and white matter microstructure) and depressive symptoms in a large sample (N = {\textasciitilde}5000) of adolescents (aged 9–13 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We used three waves of follow-up data when the youth were aged 10–11 years, 11–12 years, and 12–13 years, respectively. We used generalised linear-mixed models (H1) and structural equation modelling (H2 \& H3) to test our hypotheses. Hypotheses: We hypothesised that earlier pubertal timing at Year 1 would be associated with increased depressive symptoms at Year 3 (H1), and that this relationship would be mediated by global (H2a-b) and regional (H3a-g) brain structural measures at Year 2. Global measures included reduced cortical volume, thickness, surface area and sulcal depth. Regional measures included reduced cortical thickness and volume in temporal and frontoparietal areas, increased cortical volume in the ventral diencephalon, increased sulcal depth in the pars orbi­ talis, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the cortico-striatal tract and corpus callosum. These regions of interest were informed by our pilot analyses using baseline ABCD data when the youth were aged 9–10 years.
Results: Earlier pubertal timing was associated with increased depressive symptoms two years later. The magnitude of effect was stronger in female youth and the association remained significant when controlling for parental depression, family income, and BMI in females but not in male youth. Our hypothesised brain structural measures did not however mediate the association between earlier pubertal timing and later depressive symptoms.
Conclusion: The present results demonstrate that youth, particularly females, who begin puberty ahead of their peers are at an increased risk for adolescent-onset depression. Future work should explore additional biological and socio-environmental factors that may affect this association so that we can identify targets for intervention to help these at-risk youth.},

In two experiments, we gave a total of 197 children aged 4-14 years a virtual hand which moved synchronously or asynchronously with their own movements and had them interact with a VR environment. We found that movement synchrony influenced feelings of control and ownership at all ages. In Experiment 1 only, participants additionally felt haptic feedback either congruently, delayed or not at all – this did not influence feelings of control or ownership. In Experiment 2 only, participants used either a virtual hand or non-human virtual block. Participants embodied both forms to some degree, provided visuomotor signals were synchronous (as indicated by ownership, agency, and location ratings). Yet, only the hand in the synchronous movement condition was described as feeling like part of the body, rather than like a tool (e.g., a mouse or controller). Collectively, these findings highlight the overall dominance of visuomotor synchrony for children’s own-body representation; that children can embody non-human forms to some degree; and that embodiment is also somewhat constrained by prior expectations of body form.},

Despite having the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness, the etiology and neurobiology of AN are poorly understood. A growing body of research has begun to elucidate the role of reward processing, as well as cognitive and limbic networks, in the symptomology of AN. However, these advances have so far failed to contribute therapeutically, suggesting a new understanding may be necessary. A disturbance in the interoceptive system, involved in perceiving and interpreting the physiological condition of the body, has recently been proposed as a central mechanism of pathology in AN, through links to hunger and satiety, risk prediction errors, emotional awareness, and body dysmorphia. This review summarizes the existing literature in order to clarify possible underlying mechanisms and proposes a novel model of the neuro-circuitry of AN. Detailed neuroanatomical studies and new methods for studying interoception may allow further reﬁnement of this model and the development of improved treatment.},

	abstract = {Synchronous, but not asynchronous, multisensory stimulation has been successfully employed to manipulate the experience of body ownership, as in the case of the rubber hand illusion. Hence, it has been assumed that the rubber hand illusion is bound by the same temporal rules as in multisensory integration. However, empirical evidence of a direct link between the temporal limits on the rubber hand illusion and those on multisensory integration is still lacking. Here we provide the ﬁrst comprehensive evidence that individual susceptibility to the rubber hand illusion depends upon the individual temporal resolution in multisensory perception, as indexed by the temporal binding window. In particular, in two studies we showed that the degree of temporal asynchrony necessary to prevent the induction of the rubber hand illusion depends upon the individuals’ sensitivity to perceiving asynchrony during visuo-tactile stimulation. That is, the larger the temporal binding window, as inferred from a simultaneity judgment task, the higher the level of asynchrony tolerated in the rubber hand illusion. Our results suggest that current neurocognitive models of body ownership can be enriched with a temporal dimension. Moreover, our results suggest that the different aspects of body ownership operate over different time scales.},

In contrast to medical models or latent variable approaches, network theory suggests that psychiatric syndromes result from systems of causal and reciprocal symptom relationships. Despite the promise of this approach to elucidate key mechanisms contributing to the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs), thus far, few applications of network analysis have been tested in ED samples. We first present an overview of network theory, review the existing findings in the ED literature, and discuss the limitations of this literature to date. In particular, the reliance on cross-sectional designs, use of single-item selfreports of symptoms, and instability of results have raised concern about the inferences that can be made from network analyses. We outline several areas to address in future ED network analytic research, which include the use of prospective designs and adoption of multi-modal assessment methods. Doing so will provide a clearer understanding of whether network analysis can enhance our current understanding of ED psychopathology and inform clinical interventions.},

A growing number of studies employing this methodology has been conducted in eating disorders (EDs). We aimed to review those studies to provide evidence and limitations for a novel conceptualisation of EDs.
Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines and PICOS criteria, studies eligible for inclusion were those employing network analysis in people with a clinically defined diagnosis of ED. Twenty‐five studies were included and were analysed in relation to diagnosis, comorbidity, and treatment outcome.
Results: Despite the central role of overvaluation of body shape and weight and cognitive restraint across ED diagnoses, ineffectiveness, interoceptive awareness and affective problems appear central symptoms. Ineffectiveness and interoceptive awareness emerge as bridge symptoms promoting comorbidity in people with anorexia nervosa and in mixed ED samples. Although few studies assessed treatment outcome, there is evidence supporting the predictive role of central network nodes.
Conclusions: Ineffectiveness, interoceptive ability and affective problems may be included in the core ED psychopathology, in addition to ED‐specific symptoms. Network analysis is a promising method to reconceptualize comorbidity. Future studies are recommended to include general psychopathology in ED networks, to assess connections with the external field and clinical meaning of network connectivity.},

	abstract = {Purpose  Network studies of eating disorder (ED) symptoms have identified central and bridge symptoms in Western samples, yet few network models of ED symptoms have been tested in non-Western samples, especially among preadolescents. The current study tested a network model of ED symptoms in Iranian preadolescents (ages 9 to 13), as well as a model of co-occurring social anxiety disorder (SAD) and ED symptoms.
Method  Preadolescent boys (n = 405) and girls (n = 325) completed the Children Eating Attitudes Test-20 and Social Anxiety Scale for Children. We estimated two network models (ED and ED/SAD networks) and identified central and bridge symptoms, as well as tested if these models differed by sex.
Results  We found that discomfort eating sweets were the most central symptoms in ED networks. Concern over being judged was central in networks including both ED and SAD symptoms. Additionally, concern over being judged was the strongest bridge symptoms. Networks did not differ by sex.
Conclusion  Future research is needed to test if interventions focused on bridge symptoms (i.e., concern over being judged) as primary intervention points target comorbid ED-SAD pathology in preadolescents at risk for ED and SAD. Level of evidence  Level III; Evidence obtained from well-designed observational study, including case–control design for relevant aspects of the study.},

Yet, remission is not achieved for about half of adolescents with AN receiving FBT. Understanding patient- and parent-level factors that predict FBT response may inform treatment development and improve outcomes.
Methods.—Network analysis was used to identify the most central symptoms of AN in adolescents who completed the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) prior to FBT (N = 409). Bridge pathways between adolescent AN and parental self-efficacy in facilitating their child’s recovery from AN were identified in a subset of participants (n = 184). Central and bridge symptoms were tested as predictors of early response (⩾2.4 kg weight gain by the fourth session of FBT) and end-of-treatment weight restoration [⩾95\% expected body weight (EBW)] and full remission (⩾95\% EBW and EDE score within 1 standard deviation of norms).
Results.—The most central symptoms of adolescent AN included desiring weight loss, dietary restraint, and feeling fat. These symptoms predicted early response, but not end-of-treatment outcomes. Bridge symptoms were parental beliefs about their responsibility to renourish their child, adolescent discomfort eating in front of others, and adolescent dietary restraint. Bridge symptoms predicted end-of-treatment weight restoration, but not early response nor full remission.
Conclusions.—Findings highlight the prognostic utility of core symptoms of adolescent AN. Parent beliefs about their responsibility to renourish their child may maintain associations between},

Network analysis is a statistical approach useful for examining how symptoms interrelate and how comorbidities may be maintained. The present study used network analysis to: (1) test central symptoms within an IA-ED network, (2) identify symptoms that may bridge the association between IA and ED symptoms, and (3) explore whether central and bridge symptoms predict ED remission at discharge from intensive treatment. A regularized partial correlation network was estimated in a sample of 428 adolescent (n=187) and adult (n=241) ED patients in a partial hospital program. IA was assessed using items from the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, and ED symptoms were assessed using items from the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire. Central symptoms within the network were strong desire to lose weight, feeling guilty, and listening for information from the body about emotional state. The most central symptom bridging IA and ED symptoms was (not) feeling safe in one’s body. Of the central symptoms, greater desire to lose weight predicted lower likelihood of remission at treatment discharge. Bridge symptoms did not significantly predict remission. Body mistrust may be a mechanism by which associations between IA and EDs are maintained. Findings suggest targeting central and bridge symptoms may be helpful to improve IA and ED symptoms.},

EDA has a history in psychophysiological (including emotional or cognitive stress) research since 1879, but it was not until recent years that researchers began using EDA for pathophysiological applications like the assessment of fatigue, pain, sleepiness, exercise recovery, diagnosis of epilepsy, neuropathies, depression, and so forth. The advent of new devices and applications for EDA has increased the development of novel signal processing techniques, creating a growing pool of measures derived mathematically from the EDA. For many years, simply computing the mean of EDA values over a period was used to assess arousal. Much later, researchers found that EDA contains information not only in the slow changes (tonic component) that the mean value represents, but also in the rapid or phasic changes of the signal. The techniques that have ensued have intended to provide a more sophisticated analysis of EDA, beyond the traditional tonic/phasic decomposition of the signal. With many researchers from the social sciences, engineering, medicine, and other areas recently working with EDA, it is timely to summarize and review the recent developments and provide an updated and synthesized framework for all researchers interested in incorporating EDA into their research.},

For mobile applications, short term ECG measurement may be used for HRV analysis since the conventional five minute long recordings might be inadequately long. Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test. We validated these HRV features by showing significant differences in HRV features existed between the two stages. Our results indicated that ultra short term analysis of heart rate and RR intervals within 10 s, RMSSD and PNN50 within 30 s, HF within 40 s, LF/HF, normalized LF, and normalized HF within 50 s could be reliably performed for monitoring mental stress in mobile settings.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the change in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats, is an emergent property of interdependent regulatory systems that operate on different time scales to adapt to challenges and achieve optimal performance. This article brieﬂy reviews neural regulation of the heart, and its basic anatomy, the cardiac cycle, and the sinoatrial and atrioventricular pacemakers. The cardiovascular regulation center in the medulla integrates sensory information and input from higher brain centers, and afferent cardiovascular system inputs to adjust heart rate and blood pressure via sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways. This article reviews sympathetic and parasympathetic inﬂuences on the heart, and examines the interpretation of HRV and the association between reduced HRV, risk of disease and mortality, and the loss of regulatory capacity. This article also discusses the intrinsic cardiac nervous system and the heart-brain connection, through which afferent information can inﬂuence activity in the subcortical and frontocortical areas, and motor cortex. It also considers new perspectives on the putative underlying physiological mechanisms and properties of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF), very-low-frequency (VLF), low-frequency (LF), and high-frequency (HF) bands. Additionally, it reviews the most common time and frequency domain measurements as well as standardized data collection protocols. In its ﬁnal section, this article integrates Porges’ polyvagal theory, Thayer and colleagues’ neurovisceral integration model, Lehrer et al.’s resonance frequency model, and the Institute of HeartMath’s coherence model. The authors conclude that a coherent heart is not a metronome because its rhythms are characterized by both complexity and stability over longer time scales.

	abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\textasciitilde}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\textasciitilde}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is the ﬂuctuation in time between successive heartbeats and is deﬁned by interbeat intervals. Researchers have shown that short-term (∼5min) and long-term (≥24-h) HRV measurements are associated with adaptability, health, mobilization, and use of limited regulatory resources, and performance. Long-term HRV recordings predict health outcomes heart attack, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Despite the prognostic value of long-term HRV assessment, it has not been broadly integrated into mainstream medical care or personal health monitoring. Although shortterm HRV measurement does not require ambulatory monitoring and the cost of long-term assessment, it is underutilized in medical care. Among the diverse reasons for the slow adoption of short-term HRV measurement is its prohibitive time cost (∼5 min). Researchers have addressed this issue by investigating the criterion validity of ultrashort-term (UST) HRV measurements of less than 5-min duration compared with shortterm recordings. The criterion validity of a method indicates that a novel measurement procedure produces comparable results to a currently validated measurement tool. We evaluated 28 studies that reported UST HRV features with a minimum of 20 participants; of these 17 did not investigate criterion validity and 8 primarily used correlational and/or group difference criteria. The correlational and group difference criteria were insufﬁcient because they did not control for measurement bias. Only three studies used a limits of agreement (LOA) criterion that speciﬁed a priori an acceptable difference between novel and validated values in absolute units. Whereas the selection of rigorous criterion validity methods is essential, researchers also need to address such issues as acceptable measurement bias and control of artifacts. UST measurements are proxies of proxies. They seek to replace short-term values which, in turn, attempt to estimate long-term metrics. Further adoption of UST HRV measurements requires compelling evidence that these metrics can forecast real-world health or performance outcomes. Furthermore, a single false heartbeat can dramatically alter HRV metrics. UST measurement solutions must automatically edit artifactual interbeat interval values otherwise HRV measurements will be invalid. These are the formidable challenges that must be addressed before HRV monitoring can be accepted for widespread use in medicine and personal health care.},

Although the inﬂuence of sudomotor nerve activity and the sympathetic nervous system on EDA is well established, the mechanisms underlying EDA signal generation are not completely understood. Owing to simplicity of instrumentation and modern electronics, these measurements have recently seen a transfer from the laboratory to wearable devices, sparking numerous novel applications while bringing along both challenges and new opportunities. In addition to developments in electronics and miniaturization, current trends in material technology and manufacturing have sparked innovations in electrode technologies, and trends in data science such as machine learning and sensor fusion are expanding the ways that measurement data can be processed and utilized. Although challenges remain for the quality of wearable EDA measurement, ongoing research and developments may shorten the quality gap between wearable EDA and standardized recordings in the laboratory. In this topical review, we provide an overview of the basics of EDA measurement, discuss the challenges and opportunities of wearable EDA, and review recent developments in instrumentation, material technology, signal processing, modeling and data science tools that may advance the ﬁeld of EDA research and applications over the coming years.},

Both algorithms are extremely sensitive to their input parameters: m (length of the data segment being compared), r (similarity criterion) and N (length of data). There is no established consensus on parameter selection in short data sets, especially for biological data. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to examine the robustness of these two entropy algorithms by exploring the effect of changing parameter values on short data sets. Data with known theoretical entropy qualities as well as experimental data from both healthy young and older adults was utilized. Our results demonstrate that both ApEn and SampEn are extremely sensitive to parameter choices, especially for very short data sets, N≤200. We suggest using N larger than 200, an m of 2 and examine several r values before selecting your parameters. Extreme caution should be used when choosing parameters for experimental studies with both algorithms. Based on our current findings, it appears that SampEn is more reliable for short data sets. SampEn was less sensitive to changes in data length and demonstrated fewer problems with relative consistency.},

	abstract = {Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a measure of sweat gland activation due to sympathetic arousal, and it has been widely used to assess human response to stressful stimuli, including pain. Tonic and phasic components are typically obtained from EDA to assess sympathetic arousal. More recently, spectral analysis of EDA has been found to be more sensitive and reproducible than tonic and phasic components. However, none of the aforementioned analyses incorporate the differential characteristics of EDA, which could be more sensitive to capturing fast-changing dynamics associated with pain responses. We have tested the feasibility of using the derivative of phasic EDA and the modified time-varying spectral analysis of EDA. Sixteen subjects underwent four levels of pain stimulation using electric stimulation. Fivesecond segments of EDA were used for each level of stimulation, and pre-stimulation segments were considered stimulation level 0. We used support vector machines with the radial basis function kernel and multi-layer perceptron for three different scenarios of stimulation-level classification tasks: five stimulation levels (four levels of stimulation plus no stimulation); low, medium, and high pain stimulation (stimulation levels 0-1, 2, and 3-4, respectively); and high stimulation levels (stimulation levels 3-4) vs. no stimulation. The maximum balanced accuracies were 44\% (five stimulation levels), 63\% (for low, medium, and high pain stimulation), and 87\% (sensitivity 83\% and specificity 89\%, for high stimulation vs. no stimulation). The differential characteristics of EDA contributed highly to the accuracy of pain stimulation level detection of the classifiers. The external validity was not considered in the study.},

Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the data of two healthy volunteers while awake and at rest. We used a systematic process that takes advantage of the tail behavior of various statistical distributions to ensure capturing the point process structure in EDA. We verified the presence of this temporal structure in a new dataset of subjects. Our results demonstrate for the first time that point process structure of EDA pulses can be identified across multiple datasets using a systematic method that is still rooted in the underlying physiology.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the increasing demands of ultra-short-term heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) for practical ambulatory applications, there have been few studies that have investigated R-R interval recording for less than 5 min for HRV analysis. It has not been extensively validated, and, currently, no normative data for ultrashort-term HRV exist. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between standard 5-min and ultra-short-term HRV by collecting data from a large population consisting of a wide range of age groups. Materials and Methods: The 5-min R-R interval series were obtained from 467 healthy volunteers ranging from 8 to 69 years of age. The original R-R interval was segmented into 270, 240, 210, 180, 150, 120, 90, 60, 30, 20, and 10 s, and those HRV features most commonly reported within the literature were calculated and compared with those using the original 5-min R-R interval series. The Pearson correlation r, the p value by the Kruskal–Wallis test, and the Bland–Altman plot analysis computations were performed for each HRV variable calculated using different lengths of RR interval series. Results: For each HRV variable, the minimum length of the R-R interval required to reliably estimate the 5-min HRV was identified. The results were different for each age group: 10 s for HR, 20 s for high-frequency, 30 s for root mean square difference, 60 s for proportion of the number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50 ms divided by total number of NNs, 90 s for low-frequency, normalized low-frequency, normalized high-frequency, and low-frequency/high-frequency, 240 s for standard deviation of successive NN interval differences and time–frequency, and 270 s for very low-frequency. In addition, the reference value for short-term HRV from normal healthy subjects was also presented. Conclusions: Some HRV variables calculated from RR interval series shorter than 5 min were well matched with those calculated from the 5-min R-R interval. Thus, ultra-short-term HRV is likely to be a good surrogate method to assess trends in HRV.},

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the amount of norepinephrine (NE) released from the cardiac sympathetic terminals and short-term HRV. The study comprised 8 healthy subjects, 12 patients with major depression, and 7 patients with panic disorder. Cardiac NE spillover was determined using direct coronary sinus blood sampling coupled with an NE isotope dilution methodology. Short-term HRV was quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis, symbolic dynamics, sample entropy, and standard time and frequency domain measures. Neither HRV nor cardiac NE spillover was significantly different between the analyzed groups. None of the standard HRV metrics was significantly correlated with cardiac NE spillover, but there was a moderate correlation between two complexity measures of HRV (symbolic dynamics) and cardiac NE spillover (patterns with 2 like variations, r = −0.37 and P = 0.05; and patterns with no variations: r = 0.34 and P = 0.06). In conclusion, there is no correlation between standard HRV measures and cardiac NE spillover in humans. Short-term complexity of heart rate is only moderately affected by sympathetic neural outflow. Therefore, the predictive value of most HRV measures for sudden cardiac death may predominantly result from their capacity to capture vagally mediated heart rate modulations.},

The variability of SCR shapes hereby complicates the proper decomposition of SC data. A method is proposed for full decomposition of SC data into tonic and phasic components. A twocompartment diffusion model was found to adequately describe a standard SCR shape based on the process of sweat diffusion. Nonnegative deconvolution is used to decompose SC data into discrete compact responses and at the same time assess deviations from the standard SCR shape, which could be ascribed to the additional process of pore opening. Based on the result of single non-overlapped SCRs, response parameters can be estimated precisely as shown in a paradigm with varying inter-stimulus intervals.},

	abstract = {Ultra-short-term HRV features assess minor autonomous nervous system variations such as variations resulting from cognitive stress peaks during demanding tasks. Several studies compare ultra-short-term and short-term HRV measurements to investigate their reliability. However, existing experiments are conducted in low cognitively demanding environments. In this paper, we propose to evaluate these measurements’ reliability under cognitively demanding tasks using a near reallife setting. For this purpose, we selected 31 HRV features, extracted from data collected from 21 programmers performing code comprehension, and compared them across 18 different time frames, ranging from 3 min to 10 s. Statistical signiﬁcance and correlation tests were performed between the features extracted using the larger window (3 min) and the same features extracted with the other 17 time frames. We paired these analyses with Bland–Altman plots to inspect how the extraction window size affects the HRV features. The main results show 13 features that presented at least 50\% correlation when using 60-second windows. The HF and mNN features achieved around 50\% correlation using a 30-second window. The 30-second window was the smallest time frame considered to have reliable measurements. Furthermore, the mNN feature proved to be quite robust to the shortening of the time resolution.},

They are intended to be a stand-alone source for newcomers and experienced users. A short outline of principles for electrodermal measurement is given, and recommendations from an earlier report (Fowles et al., 1981) are incorporated. Three fundamental techniques of EDA recording are described: (1) endosomatic recording without the application of an external current, (2) exosomatic recording with direct current (the most widely applied methodology), and (3) exosomatic recording with alternating current—to date infrequently used but a promising future methodology. In addition to EDA recording in laboratories, ambulatory recording has become an emerging technique. Speciﬁc problems that come with this recording of EDA in the ﬁeld are discussed, as are those emerging from recording EDA within a magnetic ﬁeld (e.g., fMRI). Recommendations for the details that should be mentioned in publications of EDA methods and results are provided.},

	abstract = {Mental stress reduces performances, on the work place and in daily life, and is one of the first causes of cognitive dysfunctions, cardiovascular disorders and depression. This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and nonlinear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behavior during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behavior. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.},

	abstract = {Background: This paper suggests a method to assess the extent to which ultra-short Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features (less than 5 min) can be considered as valid surrogates of short HRV features (nominally 5 min). Short term HRV analysis has been widely investigated for mental stress assessment, whereas the validity of ultra-short HRV features remains unclear. Therefore, this study proposes a method to explore the extent to which HRV excerpts can be shortened without losing their ability to automatically detect mental stress.
Methods: ECGs were acquired from 42 healthy subjects during a university examination and resting condition. 23 features were extracted from HRV excerpts of different lengths (i.e., 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, and 5 min). Significant differences between rest and stress phases were investigated using non-parametric statistical tests at different timescales. Features extracted from each ultra-short length were compared with the standard short HRV features, assumed as the benchmark, via Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots during rest and stress phases. Using data-driven machine learning approaches, a model aiming to detect mental stress was trained, validated and tested using short HRV features, and assessed on the ultra-short HRV features.
Results: Six out of 23 ultra-short HRV features (MeanNN, StdNN, MeanHR, StdHR, HF, and SD2) displayed consistency across all of the excerpt lengths (i.e., from 5 to 1 min) and 3 out of those 6 ultra-short HRV features (MeanNN, StdHR, and HF) achieved good performance (accuracy above 88\%) when employed in a well-dimensioned automatic classifier.
Conclusion: This study concluded that 6 ultra-short HRV features are valid surrogates of short HRV features for mental stress investigation.},

	abstract = {Background: Anxiety disorders increase risk of future cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, even after controlling for confounds including smoking, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status, and irrespective of a history of medical disorders. While impaired vagal function, indicated by reductions in heart rate variability (HRV), may be one mechanism linking anxiety disorders to CVD, prior studies have reported inconsistent ﬁndings highlighting the need for meta-analysis.
Method: Studies comparing resting-state HRV recordings in patients with an anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis and healthy controls were considered for meta-analysis.
Results: Meta-analyses were based on 36 articles, including 2086 patients with an anxiety disorder and 2294 controls. Overall, anxiety disorders were characterized by lower HRV [high frequency (HF): Hedges’ g = −0.29. 95\% CI: −0.41 to −0.17, p {\textless} 0.001; time domain: Hedges’ g = −0.45, 95\% CI: −0.57 to −0.33, p {\textless} 0.001] than controls. Panic disorder (n = 447), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 192), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 68), and social anxiety disorder (n = 90), but not obsessive–compulsive disorder (n = 40), displayed reductions in HF HRV relative to controls (all ps {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion: Anxiety disorders are associated with reduced HRV, ﬁndings associated with a small-to-moderate effect size. Findings have important implications for future physical health and well-being of patients, highlighting a need for comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction.},

	abstract = {In this work, an attempt has been made to classify emotional states using electrodermal activity (EDA) signals and multiscale convolutional neural networks. For this, EDA signals are considered from a publicly available “A Dataset for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals” (DEAP) database. These signals are decomposed into multiple-scales using the coarse-grained method. The multiscale signals are applied to the Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN) to automatically learn robust features directly from the raw signals. Experiments are performed with the MSCNN approach to evaluate the hypothesis (i) improved classification with electrodermal activity signals, and (ii) multiscale learning captures robust complementary features at a different scale. Results show that the proposed approach is able to differentiate various emotional states. The proposed approach yields a classification accuracy of 69.33\% and 71.43\% for valence and arousal states, respectively. It is observed that the number of layers and the signal length are the determinants for the classifier performance. The performance of the proposed approach outperforms the single-layer convolutional neural network. The MSCNN approach provides end-to-end learning and classification of emotional states without additional signal processing. Thus, it appears that the proposed method could be a useful tool to assess the difference in emotional states for automated decision making.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the linear and nonlinear complexity measures of heart rate variability (HRV), measuring autonomic regulation, and to evaluate the relationship between HRV parameters and the severity of anxiety, in medication-free patients with GAD.
Methods: Assessments of linear and nonlinear complexity measures of HRV were performed in 42 medication-free patients with GAD and 50 healthy control subjects. In addition, the severity of anxiety symptoms was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory. The values of the HRV measures of the groups were compared, and the correlations between the HRV measures and the severity of anxiety symptoms were assessed.
Results: The GAD group showed significantly lower standard deviation of RR intervals and the square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal sinus intervals values compared to the control group (P,0.01). The approximate entropy value, which is a nonlinear complexity indicator, was also significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group (P,0.01). In correlation analysis, there were no significant correlations between HRV parameters and the severity of anxiety symptoms.
Conclusion: The present study indicates that GAD is significantly associated with reduced HRV, suggesting that autonomic neurocardiac integrity is substantially impaired in patients with GAD. Future prospective studies are required to investigate the effects of pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment on neuroautonomic modulation in patients with GAD.},

	abstract = {This Tutorial serves as both an approachable theoretical introduction to mixed-effects modeling and a practical introduction to how to implement mixed-effects models in R. The intended audience is researchers who have some basic statistical knowledge, but little or no experience implementing mixed-effects models in R using their own data. In an attempt to increase the accessibility of this Tutorial, I deliberately avoid using mathematical terminology beyond what a student would learn in a standard graduate-level statistics course, but I reference articles and textbooks that provide more detail for interested readers. This Tutorial includes snippets of R code throughout; the data and R script used to build the models described in the text are available via OSF at https://osf.io/v6qag/, so readers can follow along if they wish. The goal of this practical introduction is to provide researchers with the tools they need to begin implementing mixed-effects models in their own research.},

	abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-eﬀects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-ﬁtting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both ﬁxed- and random-eﬀects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the proﬁled deviance or the proﬁled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the proﬁled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Suﬃcient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to ﬁt specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

	abstract = {Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be “tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary ‘omnibus’ F test” (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-tests. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Speciﬁcally, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and oﬀer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random eﬀect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow and Clayton [Breslow, N. E. \& Clayton, D. G. (1993). Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models. Journal of the American Statistical Society 88(421), 9–25]), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item eﬀects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the diﬀerent statistical methods.},

	abstract = {Background: Modeling count and binary data collected in hierarchical designs have increased the use of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) in medicine. This article presents a systematic review of the application and quality of results and information reported from GLMMs in the field of clinical medicine.
Methods: A search using the Web of Science database was performed for published original articles in medical journals from 2000 to 2012. The search strategy included the topic ‘‘generalized linear mixed models’’,‘‘hierarchical generalized linear models’’, ‘‘multilevel generalized linear model’’ and as a research domain we refined by science technology. Papers reporting methodological considerations without application, and those that were not involved in clinical medicine or written in English were excluded.
Results: A total of 443 articles were detected, with an increase over time in the number of articles. In total, 108 articles fit the inclusion criteria. Of these, 54.6\% were declared to be longitudinal studies, whereas 58.3\% and 26.9\% were defined as repeated measurements and multilevel design, respectively. Twenty-two articles belonged to environmental and occupational public health, 10 articles to clinical neurology, 8 to oncology, and 7 to infectious diseases and pediatrics. The distribution of the response variable was reported in 88\% of the articles, predominantly Binomial (n = 64) or Poisson (n = 22). Most of the useful information about GLMMs was not reported in most cases. Variance estimates of random effects were described in only 8 articles (9.2\%). The model validation, the method of covariate selection and the method of goodness of fit were only reported in 8.0\%, 36.8\% and 14.9\% of the articles, respectively.
Conclusions: During recent years, the use of GLMMs in medical literature has increased to take into account the correlation of data when modeling qualitative data or counts. According to the current recommendations, the quality of reporting has room for improvement regarding the characteristics of the analysis, estimation method, validation, and selection of the model.},

	abstract = {Background The Saltin-Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale (SGPALS) is commonly used to measure physical activity (PA) in population studies, but its validity in adolescents is unknown. This study aimed to assess the criterion validity of the SGPALS against accelerometry in a large sample of adolescents. A secondary aim was to examine the validity across strata of sex, body mass index (BMI), parental educational level, study program and self-reported health. Methods The study is based on data from 572 adolescents aged 15–17 years who participated in the Fit Futures Study 2010–11 in Northern Norway. The participants were invited to wear an accelerometer (GT3X) attached to their hip for seven consecutive days. We used Spearman’s rho and linear regression models to assess the validity of the SGPALS against the following accelerometry estimates of PA; mean counts/minute (CPM), steps/day, and minutes/day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results The SGPALS correlated with mean CPM (ρ = 0.40, p{\textless}0.01), steps/day (ρ = 0.35, p{\textless}0.01) and MVPA min/day (ρ = 0.35, p{\textless}0.01). We observed no differences between correlations within demographic strata (all p{\textgreater}0.001). Higher scores on SGPALS were associated with a higher CPM, higher number of steps per day and more minutes of MVPA per day, with the following mean differences in PA measurements between the SGPALS ranks: CPM increased by 53 counts (95\% CI: 44 to 62), steps/day increased by 925 steps (95\% CI: 731 to 1118), and MVPA by 8.4 min/day (95\% CI: 6.7 to 10.0). Mean difference between the highest and lowest SGPALS category was 2947 steps/day (6509 vs. 9456 steps/day) and 26.4 min/day MVPA (35.2 minutes vs 61.6 minutes). Conclusion We found satisfactory ranking validity of SGPALS measured against accelerometry in adolescents, which was fairly stable across strata of sex, BMI, and education. However, the validity of SGPALS in providing information on absolute physical activity levels seem limited.},

However, this relationship is complex and involves many other parameters (e.g., food security and physical activity). Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the relationships between food insecurity (FI), physical activity (PA), and detachment from studies on the one hand, and student well-being, on the other. Method A total of 4410 students (mean age = 21.55, 65 192\% female) answered an online survey measuring FI, PA, detachment from studies, anxiety, burnout, depression, and satisfaction with life. Results A structural equation model (χ [18] = 585.739, RMSEA = 0.095, 90\% CI [0.089; 0.102], comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.92, NNFI = 0.921) indicated that FI negatively predicted, and that detachment from studies and PA positively predicted, the latent variable of well-being. Discussion The results of the present study highlight that students' well-being is partly determined by FI, detachment from studies, and PA. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of looking at both the diets of students, as well as the activities and experiences they have outside their studies to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing student well-being and the action leverages to promote it.},

Specifically, eating disorders are highly comorbid with other psychiatric illnesses (up to 95\% of individuals with an eating disorder have at least one additional psychiatric illness) and have extremely heterogeneous presentations, and individuals often migrate from one specific eating disorder diagnosis to another. In this Perspective, we propose that understanding eating disorder comorbidity and heterogeneity via a network theory approach offers substantial benefits for both conceptualization and treatment. Such a conceptualization, strongly based on theory, can identify specific pathways that maintain psychiatric comorbidity, how diagnoses vary across individuals, and how specific symptoms and comorbidities can maintain illness in one individual, thereby paving the way for personalized treatment.},

Puberty indices were highly correlated with each other. The physical exam stages correlated well with boys’ and girls’ testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone and less so with girls’ estradiol. The PDS and PBIP were similarly related to basal hormones. Self-report may be adequate when precise agreement is unnecessary.

Females scored higher than males on each subscale. Early adolescents scored lower than late adolescents on PT and FN, and higher on PD.

The results of the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) indicated that this scale was composed of three factors named affective engagement, behavioral engagement, and cognitive engagement, accounting for 56.01\% of the total variance. The conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) conﬁrmed the three-factor model. The affective engagement, behavioral engagement, and cognitive engagement were positively correlated with the criterion variables of objective social media use. The mean intra-correlation coefﬁcients of the three factors were 0.523, 0.451, and 0.512. The Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients of the affective engagement, behavioral engagement, and cognitive engagement were from 0.709 to 0.804. Their McDonald’s omega were 0.805, 0.805, and 0.712, which showed high reliability of this three-factor structure. The test–retest reliability of the three factors were all above 0.68 8 weeks later. Overall, our ﬁndings suggested that the SMES-A is a reliable and valid measurement to evaluate social media engagement among Chinese adolescents.},

L’objectif de l’étude est de procéder à la validation française du Body Esteem Scale (BES ; Mendelson et al., 2001 [3]) chez les jeunes hommes. Cet auto-questionnaire multidimensionnel permet d’évaluer l’estime corporelle sans se focaliser sur l’évaluation de la taille de certaines parties du corps pouvant être jugées plus féminines. Un échantillon de 382 jeunes hommes (âge moyen égal à 22±2,4ans) a complété deux questionnaires : le Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale évaluant l’estime de soi, et le Body Esteem Scale composé initialement de trois sous-échelles. Une analyse factorielle exploratoire a dégagé quatre facteurs, partiellement similaires à ceux de l’étude de validation originale, qui correspondent à la satisfaction générale envers l’apparence, au souhait de changer l’apparence et/ou le poids, à la satisfaction envers le poids et aux sentiments envers l’apparence et le poids. La qualité d’ajustement du modèle à quatre facteurs est satisfaisante. L’indice de masse corporelle et l’estime de soi contribuent à expliquer 36 \% de la variance totale de l’estime corporelle. Les implications du BES paraissent intéressantes afin de disposer d’un outil approprié pour l’évaluation de l’estime corporelle masculine, permettant de prendre en compte les relations entre l’estime corporelle négative et la psychopathologie.
Summary
The objective of the study was to validate the French version of the Body Esteem Scale (BES ; Mendelson et al., 2001 [3]) in a sample of French males. This multidimensional self-administered questionnaire assesses body esteem without assessment of satisfaction or dissatisfaction linked to the size of body parts considered as more relevant for women. A sample of 382 male participants (mean age equal to 22±2,4) completed two questionnaires: the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) assessing self-esteem, and the Body Esteem scale (BES) which was initially composed of three subscales. Exploratory factorial analysis yielded four factors, partially similar to those of the original validation study, which refer to overall satisfaction with appearance, desire to modify or change appearance and/or weight, satisfaction with weight and feelings about appearance and weight. The goodness-of-fit of the four factors model was satisfactory. Body mass index and self-esteem explained 36\% of the body-esteem variance. The BES appears useful for assessing male body esteem and taking into consideration the relationship between negative body esteem and psychopathology.},

BE-Weight was the only subscale uniquely related to weight, especially in females, with heavy individuals tending to be dissatisfied with their weight. BE-Appearance was the only subscale that consistently predicted self-esteem.

However, very little is known about what factors could act as buffers against the detrimental consequences of self-objectiﬁcation. This paper seeks to understand the role of self-compassion (the ability to kindly accept oneself or show self-directed kindness while suffering) in the perception that women have of their own bodies. Results indicate that self-compassion moderated the effect of body surveillance on depression and happiness separately among women. More speciﬁcally, for women low in self-compassion, body surveillance was negatively associated with happiness, which was explained by increased depression. In sum, our results indicate that self-compassion protects against the detrimental consequences of body surveillance.},

This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N ϭ 440, West Coast N ϭ 304, and North/Midwest N ϭ 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. Study 2 replicated the factorial validity, reliability, and convergent validity of the SATAQ-4 in an international sample of women drawn from Italy, England, and Australia (N ϭ 362). Study 3 examined a sample of college males from the United States (N ϭ 271); the 5-factor solution was largely replicated, yet there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. Future research avenues include additional item testing and modification of the scale for men, as well as adaptation of the measure for children and adolescents.},

	abstract = {Based on prior research, multiple discriminable dimensions of interoception have been defined: awareness, accuracy and sensibility. Some investigators defined
              interoceptive awareness
              as metacognitive awareness of interoceptive accuracy, assessed as correspondence between subjective confidence in and objective accuracy of one's heartbeat detection. However, metacognitive awareness has been understood quite differently: ‘a cognitive set in which negative thoughts/feelings are experienced as mental events, rather than as the self’ or as ‘error awareness’.
              Interoceptive sensibility
              , defined as self-reported interoception, distinguishes self-reported interoception from objective
              interoceptive accuracy
              , but does not differentiate between anxiety-driven and mindful attention styles towards interoceptive cues, a distinction of key clinical importance: one attention style is associated with somatization and anxiety disorders; the other has been viewed as healthy, adaptive, resilience-enhancing. The self-report Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness was developed to differentiate these attention styles. It has been translated into 16 languages and applied in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Findings from these applications suggest that differentiating interoceptive sensibility according to attention style and regulatory aspects (i) provides insights into the psychology of interoceptive awareness, (ii) differentiates between clinically maladaptive and beneficial interoceptive attention, and (iii) helps elucidate therapeutic approaches that claim to provide health benefits by training mindful styles of bodily awareness.

The systematic mixed-methods process involved reviewing the current literature, specifying a multidimensional conceptual framework, evaluating prior instruments, developing items, and analyzing focus group responses to scale items by instructors and patients of body awareness-enhancing therapies. Following refinement by cognitive testing, items were field-tested in students and instructors of mind-body approaches. Final item selection was achieved by submitting the field test data to an iterative process using multiple validation methods, including exploratory cluster and confirmatory factor analyses, comparison between known groups, and correlations with established measures of related constructs. The resulting 32-item multidimensional instrument assesses eight concepts. The psychometric properties of these final scales suggest that the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) may serve as a starting point for research and further collaborative refinement.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Heightened body awareness can be adaptive and maladaptive. Improving body awareness has been suggested as an approach for treating patients with conditions such as chronic pain, obesity and post-traumatic stress disorder. We assessed the psychometric quality of selected self-report measures and examined their items for underlying definitions of the construct. Data sources: PubMed, PsychINFO, HaPI, Embase, Digital Dissertations Database. Review methods: Abstracts were screened; potentially relevant instruments were obtained and systematically reviewed. Instruments were excluded if they exclusively measured anxiety, covered emotions without related physical sensations, used observer ratings only, or were unobtainable. We restricted our study to the proprioceptive and interoceptive channels of body awareness. The psychometric properties of each scale were rated using a structured evaluation according to the method of McDowell. Following a working definition of the multi-dimensional construct, an inter-disciplinary team systematically examined the items of existing body awareness instruments, identified the dimensions queried and used an iterative qualitative process to refine the dimensions of the construct.
Results: From 1,825 abstracts, 39 instruments were screened. 12 were included for psychometric evaluation. Only two were rated as high standard for reliability, four for validity. Four domains of body awareness with 11 sub-domains emerged. Neither a single nor a compilation of several instruments covered all dimensions. Key domains that might potentially differentiate adaptive and maladaptive aspects of body awareness were missing in the reviewed instruments.
Conclusion: Existing self-report instruments do not address important domains of the construct of body awareness, are unable to discern between adaptive and maladaptive aspects of body awareness, or exhibit other psychometric limitations. Restricting the construct to its proprio- and interoceptive channels, we explore the current understanding of the multidimensional construct and suggest next steps for further research.},

	abstract = {Background: Mind–body interactions play a major role in the prognosis of chronic pain, and mind–body therapies such as meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, and Feldenkrais presumably provide benefits for pain patients. The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) scales, designed to measure key aspects of mind–body interaction, were developed and validated with individuals practicing mind–body therapies, but have never been used in pain patients.
Methods: We administered the MAIA to primary care patients with past or current low back pain and explored differences in the performance of the MAIA scales between this and the original validation sample. We compared scale means, exploratory item cluster and confirmatory factor analyses, scale–scale correlations, and internal-consistency reliability between the two samples and explored correlations with validity measures.
Results: Responses were analyzed from 435 patients, of whom 40\% reported current pain. Cross-sectional comparison between the two groups showed marked differences in eight aspects of interoceptive awareness. Factor and cluster analyses generally confirmed the conceptual model with its eight dimensions in a pain population. Correlations with validity measures were in the expected direction. Internal-consistency reliability was good for six of eight MAIA scales. We provided specific suggestions for their further development.
Conclusion: Self-reported aspects of interoceptive awareness differ between primary care patients with past or current low back pain and mind–body trained individuals, suggesting further research is warranted on the question whether mind–body therapies can alter interoceptive attentional styles with pain. The MAIA may be useful in assessing changes in aspects of interoceptive awareness and in exploring the mechanism of action in trials of mind–body interventions in pain patients.},

	abstract = {Interoception, the process by which the nervous system senses, interprets, and integrates signals originating from within the body, has become major research topic for mental health and in particular for mind-body interventions. Interoceptive awareness here is defined as the conscious level of interoception with its multiple dimensions potentially accessible to selfreport. The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) is an 8-scale state-trait questionnaire with 32 items to measure multiple dimensions of interoception by self-report and was published in November 2012. Its numerous applications in English and other languages revealed low internal consistency reliability for two of its scales. This study’s objective was to improve these scales and the psychometrics of the MAIA by adding three new items to each of the two scales and evaluate these in a new sample. Data were collected within a larger project that took place as part of the Live Science residency programme at the Science Museum London, UK, where visitors to the museum (N = 1,090) completed the MAIA and the six additional items. Based on exploratory factor analysis in one-half of the adult participants and Cronbach alphas, we discarded one and included five of the six additional items into a Version 2 of the MAIA and conducted confirmatory factor analysis in the other half of the participants. The 8-factor model of the resulting 37-item MAIA-2 was confirmed with appropriate fit indices (RMSEA = 0.055 [95\% CI 0.052–0.058]; SRMR = 0.064) and improved internal consistency reliability. The MAIA-2 is public domain and available (www.osher.ucsf.edu/maia) for interoception research and the evaluation of clinical mind-body interventions.},

Method: The language of the MAIA was revised and children aged 7–10 years (n = 212) and adolescents aged 11–17 years (n = 217) completed the questionnaire.
Results: The original eight‐factor model was tested for fit using confirmatory factor analysis. The model had an acceptable fit in the total sample and younger subsample and overall fit in the older subsample was adequate following modification. Internal consistency was good, except for the Noticing, Not‐Distracting and Not‐Worrying scales. Results also demonstrated a negative linear relationship between the trusting scale and age, suggesting that youths may lose trust in their body as they age.

Appropriate touch can be calming, while inappropriate touch can be anxiety provoking. To examine the impact of social touching, this study compared socially high-anxious (N=48) and low-anxious (N= 47) women’s attitudes concerning social touch, as well as their affective and physiological responses to a wrist touch by a male experimenter. Compared to low-anxious participants, high-anxious participants reported greater anxiety to a variety of social situations involving touch. Consistent with these reports, socially anxious participants reacted to the experimenter’s touch with markedly greater increases in self-reported anxiety, self-consciousness, and embarrassment. Physiologically, low-anxious and high-anxious participants showed a distinct pattern of sympatheticparasympathetic coactivation, as reﬂected by decreased heart rate and tidal volume, and increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia, skin conductance, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, stroke volume, and respiratory rate. Interestingly, physiological responses were comparable in low and high-anxious groups. These ﬁndings indicate that social anxiety is accompanied by heightened aversion towards social situations that involve touch, but this enhanced aversion and negative-emotion report is not reﬂected in differential physiological responding. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This pattern, however, is derived mainly from studies that specifically examined peer pressure to engage in antisocial behavior. In the present study, age differences and developmental change in resistance to peer influence were assessed using a new self-report instrument that separates susceptibility to peer pressure from willingness to engage in antisocial activity. Data from four ethnically and socioeconomically diverse samples comprising more than 3,600 males and females between the ages of 10 and 30 were pooled from one longitudinal and two cross-sectional studies. Results show that across all demographic groups, resistance to peer influences increases linearly between ages 14 and 18. In contrast, there is little evidence for growth in this capacity between ages 10 and 14 or between 18 and 30. Middle adolescence is an especially significant period for the development of the capacity to stand up for what one believes and resist the pressures of one’s peers to do otherwise.},

	abstract = {Background.—Mental disorders may emerge as the result of interactions between observable symptoms. Such interactions can be analyzed using network analysis. Several recent studies have used network analysis to examine eating disorders, indicating a core role of overvaluation of weight and shape. However, no studies to date have applied network models to binge-eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent eating disorder.
Methods.—We constructed a cross-sectional graphical LASSO network in a sample of 788 individuals with BED. Symptoms were assessed using the Eating Disorders Examination Interview. We identified core symptoms of BED using expected influence centrality.
Results.—Overvaluation of shape emerged as the symptom with the highest centrality. Dissatisfaction with weight and overvaluation of weight also emerged as highly central symptoms. On the other hand, behavioral symptoms such as binge eating, eating in secret, and dietary restraint/restriction were less central. The network was stable, allowing for reliable interpretations (centrality stability coefficient = 0.74).
Conclusions.—Overvaluation of shape and weight emerged as core symptoms of BED. This trend is consistent with past network analyses of eating disorders more broadly, as well as literature that suggests a primary role of shape and weight concerns in BED. Although DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for BED does not currently include a cognitive criterion related to body image or shape/weight overvaluation, our results provide support for including shape/weight overvaluation as a diagnostic specifier.},

Over the last decade, researchers have started to model complex interrelations between symptoms using network models, but the literature is limited in that it has focused solely on symptoms and investigated‐specific disorders while ignoring transdiagnostic aspects of mental health.
Method: This study tackles these challenges by investigating network relations among core ED symptoms, comorbid clinical symptoms (depression and anxiety) and empirically supported vulnerability and protective mechanisms (personality traits, maladaptive cognitive schemata, perfectionism and resilience) in a sample of 2302 treatment‐seeking ED patients. We estimated a regularized partial correlation network to obtain conditional dependence relations among all variables. We estimated node centrality (interconnectivity) and node predictability (the overall magnitude of symptom interrelationships).
Results: The findings indicate a central role of overvigilance, excessive focus on inhibiting emotions and feelings, interoceptive awareness and perfectionism.
Conclusions: These results suggest that excessive control of bodily aspects by dietary restraint (possibly through inhibition) and interoceptive awareness may be important constructs that warrant future research in understanding},

Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

	abstract = {Network approaches to psychometric constructs, in which constructs are modeled in terms of interactions between their constituent factors, have rapidly gained popularity in psychology. Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this article, we present the network comparison test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of (a) network structure, (b) edge (connection) strength, and (c) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: The Type I error rate is close to the nominal signiﬁcance level, and power proves sufﬁciently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Network psychometrics has been enthusiastically embraced by researchers studying eating disorders (ED), but a rigorous evaluation of the methodological quality of works is still missing. This systematic review aims to assess the methodological quality of cross-sectional network analysis (NA) studies conducted on ED clinical populations.
Methods: PRISMA and PICOS criteria were used to retrieve NA studies on ED. Methodological quality was evaluated based on five criteria: variable-selection procedure, network estimation method, stability checks, topological overlap checks, and handling of missing data.
Results: Thirty-three cross-sectional NA studies were included. Most studies focused on populations that were female, white and, with an anorexia nervosa (AN) diagnosis. Depending on how many criteria were satisfied, 27.3\% of studies (n = 9) were strictly adherent, 30.3\% (n = 10) moderately adherent, 33.3\% (n = 11) sufficiently adherent, and 9.1\% (n = 3) poorly adherent. Missing topological overlap checks and not reporting missing data represented most unreported criteria, lacking, respectively, in 63.6\% and 48.5\% of studies.
Conclusions: Almost all reviewed cross-sectional NA studies on ED report those methodological procedures (variable-selection procedure, network estimation method, stability checks) necessary for a network study to provide reliable results. Nonetheless these minimum reporting data require further improvement. Moreover, elements closely related to the validity of an NA study (controls for topological overlap and management of missing data) are lacking in most studies. Recommendations to overcome such methodological weaknesses in future NA studies on ED are discussed together with the need to conduct NA studies with longitudinal design, to address diversity issues in study samples and heterogeneity of assessment tools.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate current theoretical assumptions about the nature of pediatric posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by examining the network structure of PTSD in a sample of youth exposed to disasters, and test for age differences. Network analysis provides the opportunity to identify “central” symptoms that may hold an outsized influence over others and are important targets for research and treatment. We hypothesized that particular symptoms would exhibit greater influence over others. We further hypothesized marked differences in symptom networks across children and adolescents.
Method: Participants were 786 youth ages 8-13 (children) and 14-18 (adolescents) exposed to Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav, assessed for PTSD symptoms using the University of California, Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index for Children. Network models were computed and constructed using the R-package qgraph, which estimates associations between symptoms and forms graphical network models.
Results: Consistent with our hypotheses, the symptom network demonstrated meaningful variability across age, particularly in the strength of associations, and the relative importance of individual symptoms to the network as a whole. Results further demonstrate that symptoms cluster together in a manner that adds a unique perspective to current model conceptualizations.
Conclusion: Network analysis is a potentially important additional conceptualization of psychopathology with related data analytic techniques. Results suggest that PTSD can be characterized as a web of interactions between symptoms. This work illuminates differences in the PTSD symptom network across development, such as the link between numbness of negative affect and amnesia in children, but not teens, as well as how the critical symptoms within that},

	abstract = {Based on emerging evidence, mood disorders can be plausibly conceptualized as networks of causally interacting symptoms, rather than as latent variables of which symptoms are passive indicators. In an innovative approach in nursing research, we used network analysis to estimate the network structure of 20 perinatal depressive (PND) symptoms. Then, two proof-of-principle analyses are presented: Incorporating stress and reproductive biomarkers into the network, and comparing the network structure of PND symptoms between non-depressed and depressed women. We analyzed data from a cross-sectional sample of 515 Latina women at the second trimester of pregnancy and estimated networks using regularized partial correlation network models. The main analysis yielded ﬁve strong symptom-to-symptom associations (e.g., cry—sadness), and ﬁve symptoms of potential clinical importance (i.e., high centrality) in the network. In exploring the relationship of PND symptoms to stress and reproductive biomarkers (proof-ofprinciple analysis 1), a few weak relationships were found. In a comparison of nondepressed and depressed women's networks (proof-of-principle analysis 2), depressed participants had a more connected network of symptoms overall, but the networks did not differ in types of relationships (the network structures). We hope this ﬁrst report of PND symptoms as a network of interacting symptoms will encourage future network studies in the realm of PND research, including investigations of symptom-to-biomarker mechanisms and interactions related to PND.

Resilience (i.e., the ability to bounce back and adapt in the face of adverse and stressful conditions) has been found to be a protective factor against ED psychopathology in the West. However, no research to date has examined resilience as a protective factor against ED psychopathology in Iran. The current study used network analysis to examine an ED and resilience network in an Iranian sample.
Method: Participants were Iranian college students (N = 478) who completed the Farsi‐Eating Disorder Examination‐Questionnaire and Farsi‐Brief Resilience Scale. We estimated a network of ED symptoms and resilience processes and identified central and bridge symptoms.
Results: Central ED and resilience nodes were discomfort in seeing one's own body, feeling guilty about eating due to shape/weight, and thinking about shape and weight making it difficult to concentrate. Having a hard time making it through stressful events bridged with binge eating and fear of losing control over eating.
Conclusion: Processes related to managing stress and binge eating appear to maintain the association between ED symptoms and resilience processes.},

This study examined the network structure of PTSD symptoms in a sample of war‐affected youth and compared the symptom networks of children and adolescents.
Methods: The overall sample comprised 2007 youth (6–18 years old) living in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Palestine, Tanzania, and Uganda amid or close to war and armed conflict. Youth reported their PTSD symptoms using a self‐report questionnaire in Palestine and structured clinical interviews in all other countries. We computed the networks of the overall sample and of two sub‐samples of 412 children (6–12 years) and 473 adolescents (13–18 years) and compared the structure and global connectivity of symptoms among children and adolescents.
Results: In both the overall sample and the sub‐samples, re‐experiencing and avoidance symptoms were most strongly connected. The adolescents' network had a higher global connectivity of symptoms than the children's network. Hyperarousal symptoms and intrusions were more strongly connected among adolescents compared to children.
Conclusion: The findings lend support to a universal concept of PTSD among youth characterized by core deficits in fear processing and emotion regulation. However, different symptoms may be particularly important in different developmental stages, with avoidance and dissociative symptoms dominating in childhood and intrusions and hypervigilance gaining importance in adolescence. Stronger symptom connections may render adolescents more vulnerable to the persistence of symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background: Sleep, anxiety, and worry are strongly related to psychiatric illness and in particular to eating disorder (ED) symptoms. However, it is unclear how these specific sleep and anxiety symptoms are interrelated with anorexia nervosa (AN) pathology.
Methods: We utilized network analysis to test our theoretically-based conceptual model, by identifying core features and illness (i.e., bridge) pathways among sleep disturbance, anxiety, worry, and ED symptoms in 267 participants with a diagnosis of AN or atypical AN.
Results: The following core symptoms were identified: shape judgement, restriction, and feeling tired. The strongest bridge symptoms included worry, feeling tired, loss of energy, and physical anxiety. Worry was connected positively to fasting, fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, loss of energy, and feeling tired, and negatively to changes in sleeping patterns. Feeling tired was connected to restriction, fasting, binge eating, and worry. Loss of energy was connected to loss of control over eating and worry. Physical anxiety was negatively connected to restriction.
Conclusions: We identified specific core symptoms and illness pathways supporting our theoretical conceptual model of how ED symptoms, anxiety, worry, and sleep disturbances inter-relate in AN and atypical AN. In particular we found that symptoms associated with sleep and anxiety were central and had strong connections with AN symptoms. In addition to targeting AN symptoms, these data suggest that targeting sleep disturbance, anxiety, and worry could improve treatment for AN.},

Available data on EDs largely reﬂects a traditional latent variable model, whereby symptoms reﬂect an underlying entity. The network model is an alternative approach where ED symptoms do not reﬂect an inferred, unobservable category or dimension, but rather are themselves constitutive of the disorder. In the present study, data from ED patients (n = 5193) that completed the Eating Disorders Inventory − 2 (EDI-2; Garner, 1991) before and after inpatient treatment were used to identify symptoms (i.e., body dissatisfaction) and characteristics (i.e., perfectionism) central to EDs. Results revealed that interoceptive awareness and ineﬀectiveness, but not body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, were central to the ED network at admission and discharge. Although eﬀect sizes were small, multiple regression analyses revealed that ineﬀectiveness at admission predicted discharge BMI (over and above interoceptive awareness and BMI at admission) and discharge depression (over and above interoceptive awareness and depression at admission), but not discharge anxiety. These ﬁndings suggest that interoceptive awareness and ineﬀectiveness are central symptoms of EDs that may have implications for treatment outcome. The implications of these ﬁndings for conceptualizing the nature and treatment of EDs are discussed.},

The SBC Italian translation was validated by conﬁrmatory factor analysis showing a good model ﬁt. The two-scale SBC factor structure was conﬁrmed. The SBC was positively associated with the Iterpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), demonstrating convergent validity between these two scales. Speciﬁcally SBC-Bodily Dissociation was positively correlated with IRI-Personal Distress subscale and SBC-Body Awareness was positively correlated with IRI-Emotional Concerns, -Fantasy and -Perspective Taking subscales.},

	abstract = {Background. The role of mentalizing and empathy in the socio-emotional processing deficits of Eating Disorder (ED) patients has been under investigated. We aimed to assess these psychological processes and their interplay with ED symptoms by means of the network analysis approach.
Methods. Seventy-seven women with EDs completed self-report questionnaires assessing ED, anxious and depressive symptoms, and underwent two computerized tasks; the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), assessing emotional and non-emotional mental state inferences, and the Empathic Accuracy Task-Revised (EAT-R), measuring accuracy in identifying others’ emotions and the extent to which those emotions are shared. A partial correlation network and bridge function analyses were computed.
Results. In the partial correlation network inference of cognitive mental states and shape concern were the nodes with the highest strength centrality. Inference of emotional mental states was the node with the highest bridge strength in the cluster of social cognition functions. Empathic and mentalizing abilities were directly connected with each other and with ED symptoms.
Conclusions. This is the first network analysis study which integrates self-reported symptoms and objective socio-cognitive performance in people with EDs. Results highlight the importance of mentalizing abilities in that they contribute to maintenance of ED psychopathology and to empathic ability.},

Thus, we aimed to use this method to identify the key psychological traits that characterize these individuals and to assess their role as predictors of surgical outcomes.
Methods: One-hundred-eighty-ﬁve candidates for bariatric surgery ﬁlled in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Revised Restraint Scale, the Power of Food Scale and the Temperament and Character InventoryRevised (TCI-R) questionnaires. All these variables were included in a network analysis. Then, the most central network nodes were entered as independent variables in a regression model that included 9-month follow-up weight outcomes as the dependent variable.
Results: The network has showed a good stability. TCI-self directedness and harm avoidance scores and STAI state and trait anxiety scores were the nodes with the highest centrality in the network. Weight outcomes were assessed in 64 patients at follow-up. Among central nodes, low TCI-self directedness was found to be the only signiﬁcant independent predictor of worse weight outcome.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings show for the ﬁrst time the interplay between personality traits and symptoms in candidates for bariatric surgery combining the network approach with a follow-up evaluation. Low self-directedness has been proved to be the node with highest centrality and the only predictor of short-term weight outcome. These data suggest the importance to take into consideration personality and psychological variables either in the pre-surgery assessment or as possible targets for pre or post-surgery psychotherapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective: Frequent co-occurrence and bidirectional longitudinal associations have led some researchers to question the boundaries between depression and anxiety. A longitudinal investigation of the interconnected symptom structure of these constructs may help determine the extent to which they are distinct, and whether this changes over development. Therefore, the present study used network analysis to examine these symptomÀsymptom associations developmentally from early childhood to mid-adolescence.
Method: We analyzed data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N ¼ 1,147). Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed on 7 occasions between ages 5 and 14 years using maternal reports. Regularized partial correlation networks were constructed at each time point, and diagnostic boundaries were explored using empirical tests of network modularity (ie, clustering of symptom nodes). Nonparametric permutation tests were used to determine whether symptoms became more associated over development, and network centrality was examined to identify developmental changes in the overall importance of speciﬁc symptoms.
Results: Symptoms formed highly interconnected networks, as evidenced by strong associations between depression and anxiety symptoms and a lack of distinct clustering. There was some evidence of an increase in overall connectivity as children aged. Feeling “anxious/fearful” and “unhappy/sad” were consistently the most central symptoms over development.
Conclusion: Minimal clustering of nodes indicated no separation of depression and anxiety symptoms from early childhood through mid-adolescence. An increase in connectivity over development suggests that symptoms may reinforce each other, potentially contributing to the high levels of lifetime continuity of these disorders.},

To this aim, time-series data in one patient can be collected through ecological momentary assessment and analyzed with the graphical vector autoregressive model, estimating temporal and contemporaneous idiographic networks. Idiographic networks graph interindividual processes that may be potentially used to tailor psychotherapy and provide personalized feedback to clients and are regarded as a promising tool for clinical practice. However, the question whether we can reliably estimate them in clinical settings remains unanswered. We conducted a large-scale simulation study in the context of psychopathology, testing the performance of personalized networks with different numbers of time points, percentages of missing data, and estimation methods. Results indicate that sensitivity is low with sample sizes feasible for clinical practice (75 and 100 time points). It seems possible to retrieve the global network structure but not to recover the full network. Estimating temporal networks appears particularly challenging; thus, with 75 and 100 observations, it is advisable to reduce the number of nodes to around six variables. With regard to missing data, full information maximum likelihood and the Kalman ﬁlter are effective in addressing random item-level missing data; consequently, planned missingness is a valid method to deal with missing data. We discuss possible methodological and clinical solutions to the challenges raised in this work.},

From this perspective, comorbidity is a (bi)directional relationship between multiple latent variables. We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization in terms of a network approach, where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.},

	abstract = {Background
              Incidences of social anxiety disorder (SAD), appearance anxiety, and eating disorders (ED) show an increased prevalence among young people. However, symptoms' associations between these disorders have not been investigated in depth. Network analysis is an approach that can be used to explain the relationship(s) between symptoms of different psychological disorders. Using network analysis, this study aimed to explore the association and potential interacting mechanisms between SAD, appearance anxiety, and ED.
            
            
              Methods
              This study included 96,218 University students from Jilin Province, China. SAD, appearance anxiety and ED were assessed using the Social Anxiety Subscale of the Self-Consciousness Scale (SASS), the Appearance Anxiety Scale Brief Version (AASBV), and the Sick, Control, One, Fat, Food questionnaire (SCOFF), Chinese versions. Network analysis was employed to investigate the symptom associations, while the stability of the network model was analyzed using statistical measures.
            
            
              Results
              
                The prevalence of ED among the total sample was 38\% (95\% CI: 38.1–38.8\%), while this figure was 31.2\% (95\% CI: 30.7–31.6\%) in males and 43.6\% (95\% CI: 43.2–44.0\%) in females. Additionally, the total score of SAD was significantly higher in females (11.83 ± 5.37) than it in males (10.02 ± 5.46) (
                P
                \&lt; 0.001). While the total score of appearance anxiety was also different significantly in gender (39.21 ± 9.49 in females vs. 38 ± 9.42 in males) (
                P
                \&lt; 0.001). Results showed that ED was associated with all three aspects of appearance anxiety, including “appearance concern,” “appearance satisfaction,” and “wish for good looks.” Appearance anxiety and SAD were also associated; specifically, symptoms of “appearance satisfaction” were significantly associated with the symptoms “easily talk to strangers” and “appearance concern”, which was also significantly associated with “embarrassed”. Compared with males, females showed significantly stronger associations with appearance anxiety symptoms, while ED symptoms were associated with “troubled by being watched” and “appearance concern”.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Appearance anxiety was associated with both ED and SAD symptoms. ED may have a potential relationship with SAD, affecting appearance anxiety indirectly. Significant differences were found among males and females in symptom associations between appearance anxiety and SAD. This study therefore clarified that young people should have body-positive interventions and challenge the normative body image discourse, which may help alleviate symptoms of SAD and ED.},

	abstract = {Background: Research indicates that difficulties across multiple socioemotional functioning domains (e.g., social emotion expression/regulation, response to social elicitors of emotion) and negatively biased interpretations of ambiguous social situations may affect eating disorder symptoms. The impact of inflexible interpretations of social situations on eating disorder symptoms is less clear. The present study therefore examined relations between inflexible and biased social interpretations, socioemotional functioning, and eating disorder symptoms.
Method: A total of 310 participants from the general population, recruited from an online crowdsourcing platform, completed measures of socioemotional functioning (e.g., rejection sensitivity, negative social exchange), eating disorder symptoms, and positive and negative interpretation bias and inflexibility on a single measurement occasion.
Results: Socioemotional functioning impairments (Pillai's trace = 0.11, p {\textless} .001), but not negative (β = .07, p = .162) or positive (β = À.01, p = .804) interpretation bias or inflexible interpretations (β = .04, p = .446), were associated with eating disorder symptoms in multiple regression models. In network analyses controlling statistically for multiple markers of socioemotional functioning, eating disorder symptoms were directly associated with negative (but not positive) interpretation bias. Inflexible interpretations were indirectly linked to symptoms via co-dampening of positive emotions. Exploratory causal discovery analyses suggested that several socioemotional functioning variables (social anxiety, depression, negative social exchange) may cause eating disorder symptoms.
Conclusions: Consistent with cognitive-interpersonal models of disordered eating, our results suggest that less accurate (biased, inflexible) interpretations of social information contribute to patterns of cognition (anxious anticipation of rejection) and emotion regulation (down-regulation of positive social emotion) thought to encourage disordered eating. Public Significance: This study suggests that less accurate interpretations of ambiguous social information encourage anxious anticipation of rejection and downregulation of positive social emotions, both of which are thought to promote eating disorder symptoms. Knowledge provided by this study about the likely relations between interpretive processes, social/emotional functioning, and eating disorder symptoms may help inform treatments for eating disorders, particularly those that attempt to modify patterns of interpretation.},

	abstract = {Background. Self-harm thoughts and behaviours (SHTBs) are a serious public health concern in young people. Emerging research suggests that pain may be an important correlate of SHTBs in young people. However, it remains unclear whether this association is driven by the shared association with other correlates of SHTBs. This study used network analysis to delineate the relationship between SHTBs, pain and other correlates of SHTBs in a population-based sample of young people.
Methods. We performed secondary analyses, using data from 7977 young people aged 5–16 years who participated in the British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey in 2004. We used χ2 tests and network analysis to examine the complex interplay between SHTBs, pain and other correlates of SHTBs, including psychiatric disorders, childhood trauma, stressful life events, parental distress, family dysfunction, peer problems and inhibitory control deficits.
Results. Pain was associated with a doubled risk of SHTBs, and likewise, SHTBs were associated with a doubled risk of pain. Furthermore, network analysis showed that although pain was significantly associated with all measured correlates of SHTBs, except family dysfunction, pain was most strongly associated with SHTBs, after accounting for these measured correlates.
Conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilise network analysis to provide novel insights into the complex relationship between SHTBs, pain and other known correlates of SHTBs in young people. Results suggest that pain is an independent correlate of SHTBs. Future research should aim to identify underlying mechanisms.},

A key assumption of the GGM is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research this is often implausible. In this paper, we extend the GGM by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model (MNM). We show how to construct MNMs and propose an 1-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate it. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that MNMs outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test (NCT) and Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) in detecting moderation eﬀects. Finally, we provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to estimate MNMs with the R-package mgm and discuss possible issues with model misspeciﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Background. Network analyses on psychopathological data focus on the network structure and its derivatives such as node centrality. One conclusion one can draw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is likely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes. However, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly central gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its neighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or controllability) of a node – its predictability. We introduce predictability, estimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers on psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality.
Methods. We carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18 published papers in the ﬁeld (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We ﬁt state-of-the-art network models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.
Results. Predictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most symptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets. Predictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood and anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis.
Conclusions. Predictability is an important additional characterization of symptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of each node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network is, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of predictability along with future directions are discussed.},

Elevated ASD traits are present in around one third of those with AN, and there is some evidence to suggest that ASD traits are associated with more severe eating disorder (ED) psychopathology. The current study aimed to examine relationships between ED and ASD symptoms in individuals with a lifetime history of AN using network analysis. One hundred and one participants completed the ED Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2). A regularized partial correlation network was estimated using a graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Expected inﬂuence (EI) and bridge EI values were calculated to identify central and bridge symptoms respectively. Isolation, difﬁculties with relating to others, and feelings of tension during social situations were most central to the network, while poor self-conﬁdence, concerns over eating around others, and concerns over others seeing one's body were the strongest bridge symptoms. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that interpersonal problems are central to ED psychopathology. They also suggest poor self-conﬁdence and social anxiety-type worries may mediate the relationship between ED and ASD symptoms in those with a lifetime diagnosis of AN. Longitudinal studies examining ﬂuctuations in symptoms over time may be helpful in understanding direction of causality.},

Difficulties in emotion regulation and heightened levels of self-criticism are two processes that have been proposed as critical risk factors. Considering the accumulating evidence that risk factors rarely work in isolation, there is a pressing need to examine how self-criticism and emotion regulations strategies interact. The present study utilizes a network analysis approach to address this goal. One-hundred and thirty-five children and adolescence (ages 8–15) completed daily-diaries every evening for 21 days (total N of assessments = 2564), reporting self-criticism and use of emotion regulation strategies focused on negative and positive emotions. Network analysis was applied to estimate contemporaneous, temporal, and between-person networks. Results show that emotion regulation strategies are generally positively associated with each other at the within and between individual levels. As predicted, self-criticism was positively associated with rumination and dampening at the between and within-person networks; unexpectedly, problem-solving also clustered with them in the contemporaneous network. Moreover, problem-solving led to nextday increases in rumination and dampening, whereas self-criticism led to next-day increases in rumination but decreases in dampening. Finally, distraction in response to negative affect was closely tied with strategies that up-regulate positive affect. Collectively, these results shed light on the complex pathways through which self-criticism and emotion regulation interact over time.},

	abstract = {Background. Traditional approaches for the classiﬁcation of eating disorders (EDs) attribute symptoms to an underlying, latent disease entity. The network approach is an alternative model in which mental disorders are represented as networks of interacting, self-reinforcing symptoms. This project was the ﬁrst to use network analysis to identify interconnected systems of ED symptoms.
Method. Adult participants (n = 143; 77.6\% women) with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, ﬁfth edition (DSM-5) ED were recruited from the community to take part in a larger ongoing longitudinal study. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-I) was used to establish diagnoses. An undirected network of ED symptoms was created using items from the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI) and the R package qgraph.
Results. Body checking emerged as the strongest and most important single symptom in the entire network by having the shortest average distance to other symptoms in the network, and by being the most frequent symptom on the path between any two other symptoms. Feeling the need to exercise every day and two symptoms assessing dietary restraint/ restricting emerged as ‘key players’, such that their removal from the network resulted in maximal fracturing of the network into smaller components.
Conclusions. Although cognitive–behavioral therapy for EDs focuses on reducing body checking to promote recovery, our data indicate that ampliﬁed efforts to address body checking may produce stronger (and more enduring) effects. Finally, results of the ‘key players analysis’ suggested that targeting interventions at these key nodes might prevent or slow the cascade of symptoms through the ‘network’ of ED psychopathology.},

The current study aims to examine which specific eating disorder and premenstrual symptoms confer risk and maintain comorbidity using network analysis. Eating disorder and premenstrual symptoms were measured using the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory and the Daily Record of Severity of Problems, respectively, in a large sample of young adult females. Network analysis was used to explicate the structure of eating and premenstrual symptom networks separately and together. Eating disorder networks replicated previous literature and identified body dissatis­ faction as a core feature, but was unique in identifying monitoring calories as an additional core feature. Central symptoms identified in the premenstrual symptom network were symptoms interference with daily life and activities and negative emotions brought on by hormone changes. Bridge symptoms between networks were identified as relating to eating behaviors, interference with daily activities, joint and muscle pain, and negative emotions brought on by hormone changes. This study suggests that the links between eating disorder and pre­ menstrual symptoms extend past their individual effects on eating behavior and are indicative of a shared un­ derlying mechanism.},

            A growing number of publications focus on estimating Gaussian graphical models (GGM, networks of partial correlation coefficients). At the same time, generalizibility and replicability of these highly parameterized models are debated, and sample sizes typically found in datasets may not be sufficient for estimating the underlying network structure. In addition, while recent work emerged that aims to compare networks based on different samples, these studies do not take potential cross-study heterogeneity into account. To this end, this paper introduces methods for estimating GGMs by aggregating over multiple datasets. We first introduce a general maximum likelihood estimation modeling framework in which all discussed models are embedded. This modeling framework is subsequently used to introduce meta-analytic Gaussian network aggregation (MAGNA). We discuss two variants: fixed-effects MAGNA, in which heterogeneity across studies is not taken into account, and random-effects MAGNA, which models sample correlations and takes heterogeneity into account. We assess the performance of MAGNA in large-scale simulation studies. Finally, we exemplify the method using four datasets of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and summarize findings from a larger meta-analysis of PTSD symptom.},

In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

	abstract = {We introduce the network model as a formal psychometric model, conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting from pairwise interactions between observable variables in a network structure. This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the inﬂuence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). In the ﬁrst generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework Latent Network Modeling (LNM) and show that, with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance-covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization Residual Network Modeling (RNM) and show that, within this framework, identiﬁable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to ﬁt, and compare, SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the freeto-use software package lvnet, which contains conﬁrmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms performs adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical example on a personality inventory dataset.},

We examined the role of regular, moderate-intensity formula aerobic exercise (312 meridian exercise) in preventing allostatic overload through increasing well-being. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} An online survey was conducted to measure CO­VID-related allostatic overload according to clinimetric criteria. The Psychosocial Index (PSI), Kellner’s Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ), short Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale ­(PHS-WB), and Whiteley-7 were used to explore mental health characteristics. Univariate statistics logistic regression analysis and a general linear model were used. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} According to 442 valid answers, 217 adults practiced physical exercise (PE) frequently (fPE, 3–5 times/every day) while 120 did it less regularly (1–2 times/week), and 105 did not exercise/practiced irregularly (controls). Restriction-related stressors were most challenging, resulting in AO in 29\% (\textit{n} = 128) of the sample. The main predictors were additional stressors (\textit{p} = 0.005) and anxiety symptoms (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001). The prevalence of AO was lower (\textit{p} = 0.018) in the fPE group when compared to controls. KSQ distress symptoms were also lower in fPE (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.0001), while total well-being was increased (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001) after adjusting for sex, age, and number of chronic diseases. According to the PHS-WB, both physical and mental well-being were higher (\textit{p} = 0.003 and \textit{p} = 0.004, respectively) in fPE. \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} Frequent moderate exercise is associated with better mental and physical well-being and a lower prevalence of AO.},

Using network analysis, in the present study we identify central symptoms of adult AN, identify key bridge symptoms between AN and anxiety/depression, and examine whether central symptoms at baseline are important predictors of treatment outcomes. We conducted network analyses for AN and comorbid depression and anxiety using longitudinal data (N = 142) with measurements at baseline, and at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month postrandomization follow-ups. We identified central symptoms and bridge symptoms and tested whether centrality values calculated at baseline were related to the prognostic utility of symptoms longitudinally. Feeling fat and fear of weight gain were among the most central symptoms of AN. Feelings of worthlessness had the highest bridge centrality connecting depression to AN. Symptom centrality at baseline was strongly related to prognostic utility (r2 = .52, .55). The finding that symptom centrality was strongly related to prognostic utility supports the validity of network theory in that central symptoms may have a particularly strong influence on clinical impairment and recovery. These analyses generate useful hypotheses about the etiology and maintenance of AN and related comorbidities and may inform future treatment development.},

Often, their multivariate structure is either ignored or treated as a nuisance. This study aims to lift this limitation by applying network analysis to explicate the multivariate pattern of risk and success factors for subjective well-being in autism spectrum disorder. We estimated a network structure for 27 potential factors in 2341 individuals with autism spectrum disorder to assess the centrality of specific life domains and their importance for well-being. The data included both self- and proxy-reported information. We identified social satisfaction and societal contribution as the strongest direct paths to subjective well-being. The results suggest that an important contribution to well-being lies in resources that allow the individual to engage in social relations, which influence well-being directly. Factors most important in determining the network’s structure include self-reported IQ, living situation, level of daily activity, and happiness. Number of family members with autism spectrum disorder and openness about one’s diagnosis are least important of all factors for subjective well-being. These types of results can serve as a roadmap for interventions directed at improving the well-being of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.},

	abstract = {Background:. Little is known about the speciﬁc factors that contribute to the well-being (WB) of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A plausible hypothesis is that ASD symptomatology has a direct negative effect on WB. In the current study, the emerging tools of network analysis allow to explore the functional interdependencies between speciﬁc symptoms of ASD and domains of WB in a multivariate framework. We illustrate how studying both higher-order (total score) and lower-order (subscale) representations of ASD symptomatology can clarify the interrelations of factors relevant for domains of WB.
Methods:. We estimated network structures on three different construct levels for ASD symptomatology, as assessed with the Adult Social Behavior Questionnaire (item, subscale, total score), relating them to daily functioning (DF) and subjective WB in 323 adult individuals with clinically identiﬁed ASD (aged 17–70 years). For these networks, we assessed the importance of speciﬁc factors in the network structure.
Results:. When focusing on the highest representation level of ASD symptomatology (i.e. a total score), we found a negative connection between ASD symptom severity and domains of WB. However, zooming in on lower representation levels of ASD symptomatology revealed that this connection was mainly funnelled by ASD symptoms related to insistence on sameness and experiencing reduced contact and that those symptom scales, in turn, impact different domains of WB.
Conclusions:. Zooming in across construct levels of ASD symptom severity into subscales of ASD symptoms can provide us with important insights into how speciﬁc domains of ASD symptoms relate to speciﬁc domains of DF and WB.},

The current study focuses on mental health networks in patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other specified eating disorders (EDs).
Method: Network analyses were applied with five mental health domains (emotional, psychological and social well‐being, and general and specific psychopathology) among 905 ED patients. Also, networks of 36 underlying symptoms related to the domains were estimated. The network stability, structure and (bridge) centrality of the nodes were assessed for the total group and each ED type. Network differences between the ED types were also examined.
Results: ED psychopathology was only weakly connected with the well‐being domains. Psychological well‐being was the most central node in the domain network. The most central nodes in the symptom network were feeling depressed, feeling worthless, purpose in life and self‐acceptance. Bridge symptoms between well‐being and psychopathology were self‐acceptance, environmental mastery, interested in life and feeling depressed. There were no network differences between the ED types in both the domain and symptom networks.
Conclusions: This study shows novel associations between well‐being and psychopathology in ED patients. Central domains and their underlying symptoms may be especially important to consider in treatment for promoting mental health in ED patients.},

These models imply different data generating mechanisms that have important consequences for the validity and validation of questionnaires. From this review, we formalize a framework for assessing the evidence for the validity of questionnaires from the psychometric network perspective. We focus specifically on the structural phase of validation where items are assessed for redundancy, dimensionality, and internal structure. In this discussion, we underline the importance of identifying unique personality components (i.e., an item or set of items that share a unique common cause) and representing the breadth of each trait’s domain in personality networks. After, we argue that psychometric network models have measures that are statistically equivalent to factor models, but suggest that their substantive interpretations differ. Finally, we provide a novel measure of structural consistency, which provides complementary information to internal consistency measures. We close with future directions for how external validation can be executed using psychometric network models.},

From a phenomenological perspective, body image disturbance has been associated with a more profound disturbance encompassing disorders of the way persons experience their own body. The aim of this study was to disentangle the complex dynamics that connect the experience of one’s own body and self-identity to the psychopathological features of AN by applying a network analysis. Fifty-seven patients with AN restrictive subtype and 27 with AN binge–purging subtype participated in the study. Eating Disorders Inventory-2 and Identity and Eating Disorders subscores, measuring the embodiment dimensions, were included in the network. Two of the main dimensions of embodiment—feeling extraneous from one’s own body and feeling oneself through objective measures—were the nodes with the highest strength together with interoceptive awareness (IA). IA was a node included in several pathways connecting embodiment dimensions with most of the AN psychopathological dimensions. The centrality of the embodiment disorder suggests the importance of considering the body image disturbance in people with AN as resulting from their diﬃculty in experiencing inner states and as a tool to build its own self. This assumption may orient therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: The extent to which psychological wellbeing may play a preventive and therapeutic role in the development and maintenance of adolescent emotional disorders depends, in part, on the nature of the overlap between these two constructs. We estimated network analysis to examine the relationship between adolescent psychopathology (measured by depression and anxiety symptoms) and psychological wellbeing (measured by happiness, optimism, social support, perceived control, and gratitude).
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a large community sample of Kenyan adolescents (N = 2192, aged 13–18). Network analyses were conducted to examine the topology, stability, centrality, and bridge nodes of a network of psychopathology and psychological wellbeing measures.
Results: Two distinct community clusters emerged, one for psychopathology nodes and another for wellbeing nodes, suggesting that these are two distinct but connected concepts. Central and bridge nodes of the wellbeing and psychopathology network were identified. The most central nodes in the network were family provides emotional help and support and self-blame; the strongest negative edges between psychopathology and psychological wellbeing were depressed mood—I love life and irritability—I am a joyful person; the main bridge nodes were family helps me and I can talk to family about problems.
Conclusions: Our findings expand understanding of the relationship between psychopathology and wellbeing in an understudied population and are suggestive of how psychological wellbeing can inform psychopathological treatment and preventive efforts in low-income regions such as those in Sub Saharan Africa.},

A lack of such reporting standards may foster researcher degrees of freedom and could provide fertile ground for questionable reporting practices. Here, we introduce reporting standards for network analyses in cross-sectional data, along with a tutorial and two examples.

We analyze a database of 1973 healthy young adults who were queried on the IRI scale. A regularized partial correlation network is estimated. In the visualization of the model, items are displayed as nodes, edges represent regularized partial correlations between the nodes. Centrality denotes a node's connectedness with other nodes in the network. The spinglass algorithm and the walktrap algorithm are used to identify communities of items, and state-of-the-art stability analyses are carried out. The spinglass algorithm identiﬁes four communities, the walktrap algorithm ﬁve communities. Positive edges are found among nodes belonging to the same community as well as among nodes belonging to diﬀerent communities. Item 14 (“Other people's misfortunes do not usually disturb me a great deal”) shows the highest strength centrality score. The network edges and node centrality order are accurately estimated. Network analysis highlights interesting connections between indicators of empathy; how these results impact empathy models must be assessed in further studies.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientiﬁc theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufﬁciently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel deﬁnitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics.

The ﬁrst approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypomanic symptoms between bipolar-I disorder (BD-I) and bipolar-II disorder (BD-II) are often indistinguishable in clinical practice. This study compared the network structure of hypomanic symptoms between patients with BD-I and BD-II.
Methods: The 32-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) was used to assess hypomanic symptoms. Network model was generated in BD-I and BD-II patients. Centrality index of strength was used to quantify the importance of each symptom in the network. The Network Comparison Test (NCT) was used to assess the differences in hypomanic symptoms between BD-I and BD-II patients.
Results: Altogether, 423 patients with BD (BD-I: 191 and BD-II: 232) were included. The most central symptom was HCL17 “I am more ﬂirtatious and/or am more sexually active” (strength BD−I = 5.21) and HCL12 “I have more ideas, I am more creative” (strength BD−II = 6.84) in BD-I and BD-II samples, respectively. The results of NCT showed that four nodes (HCL12 “I have more ideas, I am more creative,” HCL17 “I am more ﬂirtatious and/or am more sexually active,” HCL23 “My thoughts jump from topic to topic,” and HCL31 “I drink more alcohol”) were signiﬁcantly different between the BD-I and BD-II samples. Two edges (HCL3 “I am more self-conﬁdent”–HCL17 “I am more ﬂirtatious and/or am more sexually active,” and HCL10 “I am physically more active (sport, etc.)”–HCL24 “I do things more quickly and/or more easily”) were signiﬁcantly stronger in BD-I compared to BD-II patients.
Conclusion: The network structure of hypomanic symptoms is different between BD-I and BD-II patients. Interventions targeting the respective central symptoms and edges should be developed for BD-I and BD-II separately.},

	abstract = {Objective: Recent developments in psychometrics enable the application of network models to analyze psychological disorders, such as PTSD. Instead of understanding symptoms as indicators of an underlying common cause, this approach suggests symptoms co-occur in syndromes due to causal interactions. The current study has two goals: (1) examine the network structure among the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and (2) incorporate clinically relevant variables to the network to investigate whether PTSD symptoms exhibit differential relationships with suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, physical functioning/quality of life (QoL), mental functioning/QoL, age, and sex.
Method: We utilized a nationally representative U.S. military veteran’s sample; and analyzed the data from a subsample of 221 veterans who reported clinically signiﬁcant DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Networks were estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. Data and code are published along with the paper.
Results: The 20-item DSM-5 PTSD network revealed that symptoms were positively connected within the network. Especially strong connections emerged between nightmares and ﬂashbacks; blame of self or others and negative trauma-related emotions, detachment and restricted affect; and hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response. The most central symptoms were negative trauma-related emotions, ﬂashbacks, detachment, and physiological cue reactivity. Incorporation of clinically relevant covariates into the network revealed paths between self-destructive behavior and suicidal ideation; concentration difﬁculties and anxiety, depression, and mental QoL; and depression and restricted affect.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between speciﬁc DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and clinical outcomes in trauma survivors. Implications of these results for informing the assessment and treatment of this disorder, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: This study aims to examine the underlying associations between eating, affective and metacognitive symptoms in patients with binge eating disorder (BED) through network analysis (NA) in order to identify key variables that may be considered the target for psychotherapeutic interventions.
Methods: A total of 155 patients with BED completed measures of eating psychopathology, affective symptoms, emotion regulation and metacognition. A cross-sectional network was inferred by means of Gaussian Markov random field estimation using graphical LASSO and the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC-LASSO), and central symptoms of BED were identified by means of the strength centrality index.
Results: Impaired self-monitoring metacognition and difficulties in impulse control emerged as the symptoms with the highest centrality. Conversely, eating and affective features were less central. The centrality stability coefficient of strength was above the recommended cut-off, thus indicating the stability of the network.
Conclusions: According to the present NA findings, impaired self-monitoring metacognition and difficulties in impulse control are the central nodes in the psychopathological network of BED whereas eating symptoms appear marginal. If further studies with larger samples replicate these results, metacognition and impulse control could represent new targets of psychotherapeutic interventions in the treatment of BED. In light of this, metacognitive interpersonal therapy could be a promising aid in clinical practice to develop an effective treatment for BED.},

Underweight adolescents reported increased levels of internalizing problems but no increased eating disorder risk or reduced well-being. The network analysis revealed that anxious/depressed mood and attention problems were the most central and interconnected nodes for both overweight and underweight subsamples. Among underweight individuals, social problems and socially withdrawn behavior additionally functioned as a bridge between other nodes in the network. The results support psychological interventions focusing on improving mood, coping with negative emotions and tackling inner tension.},

	abstract = {The Gaussian graphical model (GGM) is an increasingly popular technique used in psychology to characterize relationships among observed variables. These relationships are represented as elements in the precision matrix. Standardizing the precision matrix and reversing the sign yields corresponding partial correlations that imply pairwise dependencies in which the effects of all other variables have been controlled for. The graphical lasso (glasso) has emerged as the default estimation method, which uses ℓ1-based regularization. The glasso was developed and optimized for high-dimensional settings where the number of variables (p) exceeds the number of observations (n), which is uncommon in psychological applications. Here we propose to go ‘back to the basics’, wherein the precision matrix is first estimated with non-regularized maximum likelihood and then Fisher Z transformed confidence intervals are used to determine non-zero relationships. We first show the exact correspondence between the confidence level and specificity, which is due to 1 minus specificity denoting the false positive rate (i.e., α). With simulations in low-dimensional settings (p ≪ n), we then demonstrate superior performance compared to the glasso for detecting the non-zero effects. Further, our results indicate that the glasso is inconsistent for the purpose of model selection and does not control the false discovery rate, whereas the proposed method converges on the true model and directly controls error rates. We end by discussing implications for estimating GGMs in psychology.},

	abstract = {An important goal for psychological science is developing methods to characterize relationships between variables. Customary approaches use structural equation models to connect latent factors to a number of observed measurements, or test causal hypotheses between observed variables. More recently, regularized partial correlation networks have been proposed as an alternative approach for characterizing relationships among variables through off-diagonal elements in the precision matrix. While the graphical Lasso (glasso) has emerged as the default network estimation method, it was optimized in fields outside of psychology with very different needs, such as high dimensional data where the number of variables (p) exceeds the number of observations (n). In this article, we describe the glasso method in the context of the fields where it was developed, and then we demonstrate that the advantages of regularization diminish in settings where psychological networks are often fitted (p ( n). We first show that improved properties of the precision matrix, such as eigenvalue estimation, and predictive accuracy with cross-validation are not always appreciable. We then introduce nonregularized methods based on multiple regression and a nonparametric bootstrap strategy, after which we characterize performance with extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate that the nonregularized methods can be used to reduce the false-positive rate, compared to glasso, and they appear to provide consistent performance across sparsity levels, sample composition (p/n), and partial correlation size. We end by reviewing recent findings in the statistics literature that suggest alternative methods often have superior performance than glasso, as well as suggesting areas for future research in psychology. The nonregularized methods have been implemented in the R package GGMnonreg.},

They provided up to seven observations over 24 years. Results revealed that being born later in historical time is associated with feeling younger by 2\% every birth-year decade and with less intraindividual change toward an older subjective age. Women reported feeling younger than men; this gender gap widened across cohorts. The association of higher education with younger subjective age became weaker across cohorts. Potential reasons for the subjective-rejuvenation effect across cohorts are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective: Eating disorders (EDs) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are highly co-occurring. This comorbidity is extremely relevant, given that individuals with comorbid ED-SAD are less likely to seek and/or benefit from ED treatment.
Method: We used network analysis to conceptualize ED-SAD comorbidity in a sample of 2,215 participants with a primary diagnosis of ED, SAD, or no known diagnosis. We used novel network analyses methods to select symptoms for our models, identify potential illness pathways (i.e., bridge symptoms) between disorders and underlying vulnerabilities (e.g., perfectionism, social appearance anxiety), and to compare across sample types (e.g., clinical vs. nonclinical). We also tested several novel network analyses methods aimed at the following methodological concerns: (a) topological concerns (i.e., which items should be included in NA models), (b) how to use empirical indices to quantify bridge symptoms and (c) what differences in networks across samples mean.
Results: We found that difficulty with drinking beverages and eating in public were bridge symptoms between ED and SAD. We also found that feeling nervous about one's appearance was a bridge symptom.
Conclusions: We identified public eating and drinking as bridge symptoms between EDs and SAD. Future research is needed to test if interventions focused on public eating and drinking might decrease symptoms of both EDs and SAD. Researchers can use this study (code provided) as an exemplar for how to use network analysis, as well as to use network analysis to conceptualize ED comorbidity and compare network structure and density across samples.},

The past years have resulted in over 40 scientific publications and numerous conference symposia and workshops. Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: What are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? And (3) how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models, and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},
